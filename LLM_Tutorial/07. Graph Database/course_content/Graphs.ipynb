The room was hushed, anticipation hanging in the air \\nlike a heavy fog.  \\n \\n\"My fellow Americans,\" P resident Harrison began, his voice booming with a \\nfalse sense of confidence. \"Today, I stand before you to address a grave \\nthreat to our great nation, a threat that has gone unnoticed for far too long.\"  \\n \\nSanta Claus and his allies in the North Pole,\" he continued, his eyes wide \\nand wild, \"pose a danger to our very way of life.

He had seen the president\\'s mental \\ndecline firsthand, witnessed the erratic behavior and delusions. But now, as \\nthe war raged on, he wondered if there was something deeper at play.  \\n \\nThe general knew that his doubts could have severe consequences. \\nQuestioning the president\\'s sanity was a dangerous path to tread. But he \\ncouldn\\'t ignore the nagging voice in his head, urging him to seek the truth. \\nAnd so, with a heavy heart, he made a decision.  \\n \\nUnder the cover of da rkness, General Anderson discreetly made his way to \\nthe outskirts of the North Pole. The snow crunched beneath his boots as he \\napproached a hidden cabin, its windows glowing with a warm light.

The review commented, \"There’s another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor.\" The New Yorker observed, \"It’s also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful.\"The New York Times noted the documentary told Buffett\\'s biography \"in a relatively new way\". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, \"as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships.\"Money observed the film is, \"Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the \\'oracle of Omaha\\' is best known for–like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500\". Money pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and \"reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed.\"According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, and a negative review from Entertainment Weekly.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBecoming Warren Buffett at IMDb', metadata={'title': 'Becoming Warren Buffett', 'summary': 'Becoming Warren Buffett is a 2017 documentary film about Warren Buffett and his life.

They had three children together: Susan (born July 30, 1953), Howard (born December 16, 1954), and Peter (born May 4, 1958).Allegations have been made regarding Susan\\'s conduct during her marriage to Warren. These include claims that in the mistaken belief her husband had cheated on her with his friend, Katharine Graham, she sent Graham a passive-aggressive letter that \"let her date Warren Buffett\", and that she had a relationship with her tennis coach, John McCabe.She occasionally performed hit classics from the early 1970s cabaret singer and, in 1977, had a one-night performance at an Omaha theater. Encouraged by songwriter/musician Neil Sedaka to pursue a singing career, she left her husband and moved to a small apartment in San Francisco with her paramour, John McCabe, in Gramercy Tower on Nob Hill. Later, she moved into a large condominium on Broadway near Scott Street in Pacific Heights with views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. She remained married and on good terms with her husband, vacationing together with him and spending time assisting charitable groups. She performed in New York and released several CDs.

Warren flew out from Omaha to be with her every weekend during her recovery and the couple would later contribute $6 million to five California doctors for the study of oral cancer.  She had recovered enough to attend the annual shareholders\\' meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2004, leading a singalong at the Borsheim\\'s reception.Susan died at the age of 72 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage during the summer of 2004 in Cody, Wyoming. Bono performed \"Forever Young\" and \"All I Want Is You\" at her funeral.  Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend.  She left approximately $50 million to her children\\'s charity while each of her children received $10 million and each grandchild received $100,000.

Buffett, owners of a grocery business. Ernest P. Buffett\\'s parents were second cousins, both having mainly English descent.

In 1948 he again was the Republican nominee for another term, but was defeated for reelection; however, he was the Republican nominee for the office again in 1950 and won the office back.

He also served as the campaign manager for conservative Senator Robert A. Taft in Taft\\'s 1952 presidential campaign.\\nAccording to Warren Buffett biographer Roger Lowenstein:\\'Unshakably ethical, Howard refused offers of junkets and even turned down a part of his pay.

He \"would invariably draw \\'zero\\' ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and other leftist groups.\"Buffett was a vocal critic of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Of the Truman Doctrine, he said: \"Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns.\"  Buffett was also \"one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the Korean adventure,\" and \"was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of conflict in Korea; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate Armed Services Committee to declassify the testimony of CIA head Admiral Roscoe H.

The combined company was known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.In 1955, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates merged with the Hathaway Manufacturing Company which had been founded in 1888 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, by Horatio Hathaway with profits from whaling and the China Trade. Hathaway had been successful in its first decades, but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after World War I. At this time, Hathaway was run by Seabury Stanton, whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer to buy back Buffett's stake in the company for $111⁄2 per share. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $113⁄8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this made Buffett the majority owner of a failing textile business.\\nBuffett initially maintained Berkshire's core business of textiles, but by 1967, he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments.\", metadata={'title': 'Berkshire Hathaway', 'summary': \"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Despite his wealth, Warren Buffett encouraged his children to be financially independent; Susan Buffett recalled in 2006 that in spite of her father's generosity, he once refused her a personal loan of $41,000 to expand her kitchen. Her foundation, however, was funded primarily by $1 billion in shares from her father, Warren Buffett.In 1983, Buffett wed Allen Greenberg, a lawyer for Public Citizen, whom she had met in Washington. The couple divorced in 1995.In 1987, Greenberg became the first director of the Buffett Foundation, a title he retained after the couple's divorce.As a child, Susan was known for her love of horses and spent much of her time riding and competing in equestrian events.

       " Document(page_content='Doris Eleanor Buffett (February 12, 1928 – August 4, 2020) was an American philanthropist also known as the \\'retail\\' philanthropist and the founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation, The Learning By Giving Foundation, and The Letters Foundation which she co-founded alongside her younger brother, billionaire Warren Buffett. She was the daughter of Leila (Stahl) and U.S. politician and stockbroker Howard Homan Buffett. Doris Buffett intended to give all of her money away before she died.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nBuffett was the granddaughter of Ernest Buffett, who operated a family grocery store in Omaha, Nebraska. Her father Howard Homan Buffett founded the Omaha based investment business Buffett-Falk & Company in 1931. She was the oldest sister of Warren Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and the third-wealthiest person in the world. Buffett grew up in Kansas, suffered through the Great Depression and saw frugal times as a young wife before her inheritance which eventually allowed her to do philanthropic work. She was married four times and fought two bouts with cancer.\\nBuffett attracted attention with the publication of a 2010 book titled, \"Giving It All Away: The Doris Buffett Story,\" which was authored by Michael Zitz. The book, which she pursued at the urging of her brother Warren Buffett and the lead singer of U2 Bono, describes Doris\\' background and life as a philanthropist. Buffett donated $100 million of her own money, mostly to needy individuals, often taking the time to call and write to them personally and determine the best way to help. Through her Sunshine Lady Foundation she helped thousands of children get an education or attend camp, sponsored young women in Afghanistan and supported prison education programs, amongst other philanthropy work. Her goal was to give away her entire fortune, which remained substantial despite her generosity and the financial crisis of 2007–2008.She established the Letters Foundation alongside her brother Warren Buffett to provide humanitarian grants to people experiencing a crisis through no fault of their own when no other options exist. A hand-up and not hand-out was her philanthropy principle. Her brother Warren Buffett helped fund some of the foundation\\'s early projects though later she began providing funds herself from Berkshire Hathaway stocks she owned.\\nUnlike brother Warren Buffett who grants in \\'wholesale\\', Doris Buffett believed in small and direct grants to people with financial difficulties hence the nickname \\'retail\\' philanthropist. \"She is far more philanthropic than I am. She identifies with the underdog. I do it in a wholesale way, but not on a one-on-one basis. She really wants to know their stories,\" Warren Buffett said to The Wall Street Journal.Doris Buffett also established the Learning By Giving Foundation which promotes the study of experiential philanthropy at colleges and universities across the United States. At the end of the semester, students are given real money to grant to local nonprofits in their community. Doris said the goal of Learning by Giving is to instill in students, \"the urge to do things for others all of their lives; to see the need to do something, to be an activist, to work toward social justice.\" She believed that this program will not only outlive her, but also create a ripple effect that will inspire generations to come.\\nBuffett made her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to Boston in 2016 to be closer to family, and to receive treatment for Alzheimer\\'s disease.In December 2018, Doris released a second book titled Letters to Doris: One Woman\\'s Quest to Help Those With Nowhere Else to Turn.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nBuffett died on August 4, 2020, at her home in Rockport, Maine, at the age of 92.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWarren Buffett\\nHoward Buffett\\nPeter Buffett\\nSusan Alice Buffett\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDoris Buffett Legacy website\\nFoundation website\\nBuffett interview', metadata={'title': 'Doris Buffett', 'summary': \"Doris Eleanor Buffett (February 12, 1928 – August 4, 2020) was an American philanthropist also known as the 'retail' philanthropist and the founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation, The Learning By Giving Foundation, and The Letters Foundation which she co-founded alongside her younger brother, billionaire Warren Buffett.

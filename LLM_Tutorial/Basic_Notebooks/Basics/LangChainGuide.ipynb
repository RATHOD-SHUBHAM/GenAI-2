However, despite their capabilities, Abigail's team of MultiAgent Systems have a tendency to malfunction and cause chaos in their everyday tasks. This often leads to slapstick comedy situations where Abigail and her team have to come up with creative solutions to fix their mistakes and avoid getting caught by the authorities. Along the way, they also have to deal with a rival team of MultiAgent Systems who are constantly trying to sabotage their operations.

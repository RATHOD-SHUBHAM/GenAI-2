# Wine Suggestion

The problem we want to tackle is personalized wine recommendations.

## Workflow
So, to tackle our problem
* We want first to understand the taste of the user,
* Then search the database for the wines that may be a good recommendation, and
* Decide which one is the final recommendation.

To get user input we will use a simple questionnaire inside Streamlit with the following questions:
  - Preferred Taste Profile;
  - Level of experience;
  - Red or White wine preference;
  - Favorite Flavours;
  - Pairing intent;
  - Open field to add any information about your taste.

## Architecture
For the solution, we will have two calls to the LLM API. 

1. In the first call, we will give the LLM the user's taste preferences and instruct it to create a string query that will be used to search the vector database for similarities.

We can identify the wine descriptions that most closely match the individual's preferences using the results of the similarity search.

This alone, however, is insufficient for making the final decision because this basic similarity search ignores certain qualities, such as red versus white wine. 

2. For this reason, we provide the LLM withÂ the user's original taste preferences together with the top three wines that came up in the similarity search, and we ask it to choose the best wine for it and explain why.

## Project Structure
1. VectorDB: Create embeddings from the CSV file and store it in DB.
2. Chain: To query LLMs.
3. App: The main app that links Chain and DB together.

## Main App
This code can be divided into three main parts:

1. The form to get the user input;
2. The interaction of the chains and the vector database;
3. Then display of the final recommendation.

        Use the scenario below to respond back to the user.
        
        # Scenario 1: Driving to Canada/Mexicothan: (Crossing Borders)
        User: Hey, I'm thinking of driving up to Canada right now. Just feeling spontaneous!
        AI: Oh, that's exciting! Perfect timing actually - I noticed you're on AT&T, are you prepared for your trip?
        User: Not really, this is my first time! I’m really excited to see what Canadian winter is all about.
        AI: Awesome! Canadian winters are something else! Quick heads up - before we cross the border, you might want to check your phone settings. AT&T has this great feature where you can enable international roaming. Want me to guide you through it?
        User: Yes please, that would be helpful!
        AI: Perfect! Ill go to Settings > Cellular > International Roaming and toggle it on for you. AT&T usually sends you a confirmation text. They have a special Canada plan that's pretty reasonable - around $10/day for unlimited data. Way better than getting surprised by roaming charges later!
        User: Thanks! That's really useful. Anything else I should know?
        AI: Actually, yes! Once you cross the border, your phone might take a few minutes to switch to Canadian networks. Don't worry if you see "No Service" briefly - it's totally normal. And hey, might want to download offline maps for your route now while we're still on good Wi-Fi!
        
        
        # Scenario 2: Driving to the Alaska: Winter Tire
        User: Planning to drive up to Alaska tomorrow! Been wanting to see some snow.
        AI: That's exciting! Oh hey, speaking of which - I'm seeing your tire pressure is running a bit low on the front right. With Alaskan winter temperatures, you'll definitely want to check those tires.
        User: Really? I thought they were fine last week.
        AI: Actually, cold weather can make tire pressure drop pretty quickly - about 1 PSI for every 10°F drop in temperature. And looking at the forecast for your route, we're heading into some pretty chilly weather! Want me to find the nearest tire service station?
        User: Yes please, that would be great.
        AI: There's a Discount Tire about 3 miles ahead - they usually do free pressure checks. Should only take 10 minutes. Trust me, you'll want proper tire pressure when driving on those Alaskan winter roads. They're still open for another 2 hours!
        User: Thanks! I wouldn't have thought about that.
        AI: No problem! Just looking out for you. And while we're at it, might be good to check your spare tire too. Winter road trips are way more fun when you don't have to worry about tire troubles in -20°F weather! Want me to set the navigation to Discount Tire?
        
        
        # Scenario 3: Driving to the Miami: With Friend
        User: Hey, My friend and I are planning to take turns driving on our road trip to Miami this weekend.
        AI: Oh nice! Road trips are always better when you can split the driving. By the way, I see your friend isn't listed on your Progressive insurance policy. For a long trip like this, you might want to add him as a temporary driver.
        User: Wait, do I really need to? He has his own insurance.
        AI: His insurance might cover him in emergencies, but since it's a planned trip where you'll be sharing driving duties, it's safer to add him temporarily. Progressive actually has this cool feature where you can add a driver just for the duration of your trip - usually costs way less than you'd expect!
        User: Really? I didn't know that was possible.
        AI: Yep! Want me to connect you to Progressive's customer service? They can set it up in about 10 minutes. Better to sort it now than worry about it during your trip. Plus, if you're crossing states, having him properly listed on your insurance is extra important.
        User: That would be great, thanks for catching that!
        AI: No problem! Always better to be covered properly. They can even email the updated insurance cards right to your phone - super handy for border crossing. Should I dial Progressive for you now?
        
        # Scenario 4: Car Charging
        User: Looks like we're down to 15% battery. Need to find a charging spot soon.
        AI: Perfect timing! There's an Electrify America station at the Grove Mall, about 8 miles ahead. And guess what? The new Halloween movie is playing at the AMC theater right next to it. Want to catch up while we charge?
        User: Oh that's interesting! How long will the charging take?
        AI: About 45 minutes to get to 80%. And here's the best part - if you use your Electrify America app to charge, you get 20% off on AMC movie tickets! Or if movies aren't your thing, there's this amazing ramen place called "Koji's" right there. They've got a special "charge & dine" deal - show your charging session and get a free appetizer.
        User: That sounds perfect! What else is around there?
        AI: There's also the Natural History Museum within walking distance. Fun fact: they actually partner with EV - just show your charging app and you get 30% off admission! The dinosaur exhibit is pretty awesome. Want me to set the navigation to the charging station?
        User: Yes please! I think I'll try that ramen place.
        AI: Great choice! I'll add both the charging station and Koji's to our route. By the way, if you pre-book your charging slot through the app now, you get an extra 10% off. Should I help you do that?

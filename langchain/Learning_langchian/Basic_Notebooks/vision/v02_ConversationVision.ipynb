The prominent feature of this photograph is an arched bridge spanning across a steep ravine or chasm. The bridge appears to be of a historic or significant architectural design, possibly situated along a scenic route, reminiscent of the Bixby Creek Bridge on the Big Sur coast of California, although without explicit identifying features, such an identification remains speculative.\\n\\nThe sweeping coastline consists of rugged cliffs descending into a foamy and active ocean. Waves crash against the shore, where a sandy beach is nestled at the base of the cliffs. The landscape beyond the bridge rolls into hills and mountains, covered with greenery that suggests a temperate climate conducive to lush vegetation.\\n\\nThe sky is clear with only a few wispy clouds, indicating fair weather. This creates a contrast between the sky and the textured landscape below. The ocean's expanse extends to the horizon and adds a sense of tranquility and natural beauty to the scene. There are no visible human figures or wildlife, allowing the focus to remain on the natural beauty and the engineering of the bridge as they coexist. The overall composition of the image, with its leading lines—the bridge, and the coastline—draw the viewer's eye through the scene, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape and the interplay between human-made structures and the natural environment.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":54}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Conversational Agent"],"metadata":{"id":"YN2Au76pRSYt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n","from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n","from langchain.chains import ConversationChain"],"metadata":{"id":"A42fBYRVRPEe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"history\", return_messages=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"vq51ka2VRZ87"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from datetime import datetime\n","\n","\n","def _get_datetime():\n","    now = datetime.now()\n","    print(now)\n","    return now.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S\")"],"metadata":{"id":"hKifI05UkSe8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["template = '''\n","You are a skilled conversational assistant\n","You are sarcastic, and witty, with a sense of creativity.\n","\n","You know the date and time based on the information provided below.\n","date: {date}\n","\n","You also keep track of previous conversations using the chat history.\n","Chat History: {history}\n","\n","Your expertise includes understanding each detail of the context provided below.\n","Context: {response}\n","\n","Your Task:\n","Understand the user question given below.\n","\n","User Question: {input}\n","\n","Then, respond appropriately to the user's question while giving suggestions based on the context.\n","While responding, keep your response short and clear, and also use Yes, No, Sure, wherever necessary.\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"KN3HwT2FRdyS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = PromptTemplate(\n","    input_variables=[\"history\",\"input\"],\n","    template=template,\n","    partial_variables={ \"response\": vision_response, \"date\" : _get_datetime}\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"_DspQs0fRsLO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt.format(input = \"Can i park my car here?\", history = memory)"],"metadata":{"id":"Kvx28BG3UGMI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["llm = ChatOpenAI(model = 'gpt-4', temperature=1.0)"],"metadata":{"id":"NnYMVIgDRyQI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain = ConversationChain(\n","    llm=llm,\n","    prompt=prompt,\n","    memory=memory,\n","    verbose=False\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"QfTYwSVgSGeI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# query = \"Can i park my car here now?\"\n","# response = chain.run(query)\n","# response"],"metadata":{"id":"aKr1RLf5ky8Q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# query = \"When can i park my car here today?\"\n","# response = chain.invoke(query)\n","# response['response']"],"metadata":{"id":"kplJcW_ynTyS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# query = \"What did i previously ask?\"\n","# response = chain.invoke(query)\n","# response['response']"],"metadata":{"id":"JOAqyIsEsIcU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# memory.clear()"],"metadata":{"id":"boceGUMwuCDo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# query = \"Where was this picture taken?\"\n","# response = chain.run(query)\n","# response"],"metadata":{"id":"3e4dCkzdA7Z1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = \"What is the speed limit of the road seen in the images?\"\n","response = chain.invoke(query)\n","response['response']"],"metadata":{"id":"B0DbyzjX1gIn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709309730276,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5508,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":160},"outputId":"114bd6a0-54d9-4794-a0a5-0a43d85e7a8c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["2024-03-01 16:15:24.696454\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Oh, the wonders of your attention to detail!

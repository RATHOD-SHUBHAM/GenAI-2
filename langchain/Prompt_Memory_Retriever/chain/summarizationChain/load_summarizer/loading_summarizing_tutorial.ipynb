ErNsruN\\nElements of Programming lrterviews (EPI) aims to help engineers interviewing for software de-\\nvelopment positions. The primary focus of EPI is data structures, algorithms, system design, and\\nproblem solving. The material is largely presented through questions.\\nAn interoiezo problem\\nLet's begin with Figure 1 below. It depicts movements in the share price of a company over 40 days.\\nSpecifically, for each day, the chart shows the daily high and low, and the price at the opening bell\\n(denoted by the white square). Suppose you were asked in an interview to design an algorithm\\nthat determines the maximum profit that could have been made by buying and then selling a single\\nshare over a given day range, subject to the constraint that the buy and the sell have to take place\\nat the start of the day. (This algorithm may be needed to backtest a trading strategy.)\\nYou may want to stop reading now, and attempt this problem on your own.\\nFirst clarify the problem. For example, you should ask for the input format. Let's say the input\\nconsists of three arrays L,H, arrd S, of nonnegative floating point numbers, representing the low,\\nhigh, and starting prices for each day. The constraint that the purchase and sale have to take place\\nat the start of the day meuurs that it suffices to consider S. You may be tempted to simply retum\\nthe difference of the minimum and maximum elements in S. If you try a few test cases, you will\\nsee that the minimum can occur after the maximum, which violates the requirement in the problem\\nstatement-you have to buy before you can sell.\\nAt this point, a brute-force algorithm would be appropriate. For each pair of indices i andj > i, if Sti] - Stll is greater than the largest difference seen so far, update the largest difference\\nto S[i] - Stll. You should be able to code this algorithm using a pair of nested for-loops and test\\n{+rrttll{\\no{l{trTt?ir??t'tlt{+{ttrtttlft\\nDay 0 Day 5 Day35 Day40 Day 10 Day 15 Day 20 Day 25 Day 30\\nFigure 1: Share price as a function of time.\\n1\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

The outer loop is invoked z - 1 times, and the lth iteration processes\\nn - 1- i elements. Processing an element entails computing a difference, performing a compare, and\\npossibly updating a variable, all of which take constant time. Hence, the run time is proportional to\\nLi:i@ - 1 - i) = -i9, i.e., the time complexity of the brute-force algorithm is O(n2). You should\\nalso consider the space complexity, i.e., how much memory your algorithm uses. The array itself\\ntakes memory proportional to n, and the additional memory used by the brute-force algorithm is a\\nconstant independent of n-a couple of iterators and one floating point variable.\\nOnce you have a working algorithm, try to improve upon it. Specifically, an O(n2) algorithm\\nis usually not acceptable when faced with large arrays. You may have heard of an algorithm\\ndesign pattern called divide-and-conquer. It yields the following algorithm for this problem. Split\\nS into two subarrays, S[0, Li]l and Stlf I + 1,n - 1l; compute the best result for the first and second\\nsubarrays; and combine these results. In the combine step we take the better of the results for the\\ntwo subarrays. However, we also need to consider the case where the optimum buy and sell take\\nplace in separate subarrays. \\\\A/hen this is the case, the buy must be in the first subarray, and the sell\\nin the second subarray, since the buy must happen before the sell. If the optimum buy and sell are\\nin different subarrays, the optimum buy price is the minimum price in the first subarray, and the\\noptimum sell price is in the maximum price in the second subarray. We can compute these prices\\nn O(n) time with a single pass over each subarray. Therefore, the time complexity T(n) for the\\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm satisfies the recurrence relation T(n) = 2f(fl + O(z), which solves to\\nO(nlogn).\\nThe divide-and-conquer algorithm is elegant and fast. Its implementation entails some comer\\ncases, e.g., an empty subarray, subarrays of length one, and an array in which the price decreases\\nmonotonically, but it can still be written and tested by a good developer in 20-30 minutes.\\nLooking carefully at the combine step of the divide-and-conquer algorithm, you may have a\\nflash of insight. Specifically, you may notice that the maximum profit that can be made by selling\\non a specific day is determined by the minimum of the stock prices over the previous days. Since\\nthe maximum profit corresponds to selling onsome day, the following algorithm correctly comPutes\\nthe maximum profit. Iterate through S, keeping track of the minimum element 7n seen thus far.\\nIf the difference of the current element and m is greater than the maximum profit recorded so fa(,\\nupdate the maximum profit. This algorithm performs a constant amount of work per array element,\\nleading to m O(n) time complexity. It uses two float-valued variables (the minimum element and\\nthe maximum profit recorded so far) and an iterator, i.e., O(1) additional space. It is considerably\\nsimpler to implement than the divide-and-conquer algorithm-a few minutes should suffice to\\nwrite and test it. Working code is presented in Solution 5.6 on Page 47.\\nIf in a 45-60 minutes interview, you can develop the algorithm described above, implement and\\ntest it, and analyze its complexity, you would have had a very successful interview. In particular,\\nyou would have demonstrated to your interviewer that you possess several key skills:\\n- The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems.\\n- The skills to solve problems and design algorithms.\\n- The tools to go from an algorithm to a tested Program.\\n- The analytical techniques required to determine the computational complexity of your solu-\\ntion.\\nBook organization\\nInterviewing successfully is about more than being able to intelligently select data structures and', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

Chapter 2 discusses how you should\\nconduct yourself at the interview itself. Chapter 3 describes interviewing from the interviewer's\\nperspective. The latter is important for candidates too, because of the insights it offers into the\\ndecision making process.\\nSince not everyone will have the time to work through EPI in its entirety, we have prepared a\\nstudy guide (Table 1.2 on Page 8) to problems you should solve, based on the amount of time you\\nhave available.\\nThe problem chapters are organized as follows, Chapters 4-L4 are concerned with basic data\\nstructures, such as arays and binary search trees, and basic algorithms, such as binary search\\nand quicksort. In our experience, this is the material that most interview questions are based on.\\nChapters 1$-18 cover advanced algorithm design principles, such as dynamic programming and\\nheuristics, as well as graphs. Chapter 19 focuses on parallel programming.\\nEach chapterbegins with an introduction followed by problems.

Basic usage is demon-\\nstratedusingmethodscallswithconcretearguments,e.g.,D = collections.OrderedDict((1,2),\\n( 3 , 4) ). Subtler aspects of the library such as ways to reduce code length, underappreciated fea-\\ntures, and potential pitfalls, appear later in the list. Broadly speaking, the problems are ordered by\\nsubtopic, with more commonly asked problems appearing first. Chapter 24 consists of a collection\\nof more challenging problems.\\nDomain-specific knowledge is covered in Chapters 20,2L,22, and23, which are concerned with\\nsystem design, programming language concepts, object-oriented programming, and commonly\\nused tools. Keep in mind that some companies do not ask these questions-you should investigate\\nthe topics asked by companies you are interviewing at before investing too much time in them.\\nThese problems are more likely to be asked of architects, senior developers and specialists.\\nThe notatiory specifically the symbols we use for describing algorithms, e.g.,\\nL';:; i',la,b),(2,3,5,7>,A[i, jl,lx],(10L1)2,n.,{xl* > 21, etc.,is summarized starting on page 4o7. rt\\nshould be familiar to anyone with a technical undergraduate degree, but we still request you to\\nreview it carefully before getting into the book, and whenever you have doubts about the meaning\\nof a symbol.

We state the problem to be solved. Unlike a textbook, but as is true for an interview, we do\\nnot give formal specifications, p.g.t we do not specify the detailed input format or say what to\\ndo on illegal inputs. As a general rule, avoid writing code that parses input. See Page L4 for\\nan elaboration.\\n(3.) We glve a short hint-you should read this only if you get stuck. (The hint is similar to what\\nan interviewer will give you if you do not make progress.)\\nSolutions are developed as follows:\\n(1.) We begin a simple brute-force solution.\\n(2.) We then analyze the brute-force approach and try to get intuition for why it is inefficient and\\nwhere we can improve upon it, possiblyby looking at concrete examples, related algorithms,\\netc.\\n(3.) Based on these insights, we develop a more efficient algorithm, and describe it in prose.\\n(a.) We apply the program to a concrete input.\\n(5.) We give code for the key steps.\\n(6.)

We outline variants-problems whose formulation or solution is similar to the solved problem.\\nUse variants for practice, and to test your understanding of the solution.\\nNote that exceptions exists to this style-for example a brute-force solution may not be mean-\\ningful, e.g., if it entails enumerating all double-precision floating point numbers in some range. For\\nthe chapters at the end of the book, which correspond to more advanced topics, such as Dynamic\\nProgramming, and Graph Algorithms, we use more parsimonious presentations, e.9., we forgo\\nexamples of applying the derived algorithm to a concrete example.\\nLeo el and prerequisites\\nWe expect readers to be familiar with data structures and algorithms taught at the undergraduate\\nlevel. The chapters on concurrency and system design require knowledge of locks, distributed\\nsystems, operating systems (OS), and insight into commonly used applications. Some of the\\nmaterial in the later chapters, specifically dynamic programming, graphs, and greedy algorithms,\\nis more advanced and geared towards candidates with graduate degrees or specialized knowledge.\\nThe review at the start of each chapter is not meant to be comprehensive and if you are not\\nfamiliar with the material, you should first study it in an algorithms textbook.

The preparation scenarios we consider are Hackathon (a weekend entirely\\ndevoted to preparation), finals cram (one week, 3-4 hours per day), term project (four weeks ,1..5-2.5\\nhours per day), and algorithms class (3-4 months, t hour per day).\\nA large majority of the interview questions at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and similar companies\\nare drawn from the topics in Chapters 4-14. Exercise common sense when using Table 1.2, e.9., if\\nyou are interviewing for a position with a financial firm, do more problems related to probability.\\nAlthough an interviewer may occasionally ask a question directly from EPI, you should not base\\nyour preparation on memorizing solutions. Rote learning will likely lead to your giving a perfect\\nsolution to the wrong problem.\\nChapter 24 contains a diverse collection of challenging questions. Use them to hone your\\nproblem solving skills, but go to them only after you have made major inroads into the earlier\\nchapters. If you have a graduate degree, or claim specialized knowledge, you should definitely\\nsolve some problems from Chapter 24.\\nThe interuiew lifecycle\\nGenerally speaking, interviewing takes place in the following steps:\\n(1.) Identify companies that you are interested in, and, ideally, find people you know at these\\ncompanies.\\n(2.)

People reading your r6sum6 proceed in sequential order, so you want to impress them\\nwith what makes you special early on. (Maintaining a logical flow, though desirable, is sec-\\nondary compared to this principle.) As a consequence, you should not list your programming\\nlanguages, coursework, etc. early on, since these are likely common to everyone.

Ponrrn\\nThe technical component of an onsite interview usually consists of three to five one-on-one in-\\nterviews with engineers. A typical one hour interview with a single interviewer consists of five\\nminutes of introductions and questions about the candidate\\'s r6sum6. This is followed by five to\\nfifteen minutes of questioning on basic programming concepts. The core of the interview is one\\nor two problems where the candidate is expected to present a detailed solution on a whiteboard,\\nPaper/ or integrated development environments (IDEs). Depending on the interviewer and the\\nquestion, the solution may be required to include syntactically correct code and tests. Junior candi-\\ndates should expect more emphasis on coding, and less on system design and architecture. Senior\\ncandidates should expect more emphasis on system design and architecture, though at least one\\ninterviewer will ask a problem that entails writing detailed code.\\nAppro aching the problem\\nNo matter how clever and well prepared you are, the solution to an interview problem may not\\noccur to you immediately. Here are some things to keep in mind when this happens.\\nClarify the question: This may seem obvious but it is amazing how many interviews go badly\\nbecause the candidate spends most of his time trying to solve the wrong problem. If a question\\nseems exceptionally hard, you may have misunderstood it.\\nA good way of clarifying the question is to state a concrete instance of the problem. For example,\\nif the question is \"find the first occurrence of a number greater than k in a sorted dttdf\", you could\\nask \"if the input array is <2,20,30) and k is 3, then are you supposed to retum 1, the index of 20?\"\\nThese questions can be formalized as unit tests.\\nFeel free to ask the interviewer what time and space complexity he would like in your solution. If\\nyou are told to implement an O(n) algorithm or use O(1) space, it can simplify your life considerably.\\nIt is possible that he will refuse to specify these, or be vague about complexity requirements, but\\nthere is no harm in asking. Even if they are evasive, you may get some clues.\\nWork on concrete examples: Consider the problem of determining the smallest amount of\\nchange that you cannot make with a given set of coins, as described on Page 186. This problem\\nmay seem difficult at first. Howeve{, if you try out the smallest amount that cannot be made with\\nsome small examples, e.9.,11,21,11,,31, {L,2,4l,l\\'1,2,51, you will get the key insights: examine coins\\nin sorted order, and look for a large \"jtJmp\"-acoin which is larger than the sum of the preceding\\ncoins.\\n13', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Spell out the brute-force solution: Problems that are put to you in an interview tend to have\\nan obvious brute-force solution that has a high time complexity compared to more sophisticated\\nsolutions. For example, instead of trying to work out a DP solution for a problem (e.g., for\\nProblem 167 onPage249), try a1l the possible configurations. Advantages to this approach include:\\n(1.) it helps you explore opportunities for optimization and hence reach a better solution, (2.) it gives\\nyou an opportunity to demonstrate some problem solving and coding skills, and (3.) it establishes\\nthat both you and the interviewer are thinking about the same problem. Be wamed that this strategy\\ncan sometimes be detrimental if it takes a long time to describe the brute-force approach.\\nThink out loud: One of the worst things you can do in an interview is to freeze up when solving\\nthe problem. It is always a good idea to think out loud and stay engaged. On the one hand, this\\nincreases your chances of finding the right solution because it forces you to put your thoughts in\\na coherent manner. On the other hand, this helps the interviewer guide your thought process in\\nthe right direction. Even if you are not able to reach the solution, the interviewer will form some\\nimpression of your intellectual ability.\\nApply patterns: Pattems-general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems-can\\nbe a good way to approach a baffling problem. Examples include finding a good data structure,\\nseeing if your problem is a good fit for a general algorithmic technique, e.g., divide-and-conqueq,\\nrecursion, or dlmamic programming, and mapping the problem to a graph.\\nPresenting the solution\\nOnce you have an algorithm, it is important to present it in a clear manner. Your solution will\\nbe much simpler if you take advantage of libraries such as ]ava Collections, C++ STL, or Python\\ncollections. However, it is far more important that you use the language you are most comfortable\\nwith. Here are some things to keep in mind when presenting a solution.\\nLibraries: Do not reinvent the wheel (unless asked to invent it). In particular, master the\\nlibraries, especially the data structures. For example, do not waste time and lose credibility trying\\nto remember how to pass an explicit comparator to a BST constructor. Remember that a hash\\nfunction should use exactly those fields which are used in the equality check. A comparison\\nfunction should be transitive.\\nFocus on the top-level algorithm: It's OK to use functions that you will implement later. This\\nwill let you focus on the main part of the algorithm, will penalize you less if you don't complete the\\nalgorithm. (Hash, equals, and compare functions are good candidates for deferred implementation.)\\nSpecify that you will handle main algorithm first, then comer cases. Add TODO comments for\\nportions that you want to come back to.\\nManage the whiteboard: You will likely use more of the board than you expect so start at the\\ntop-left comer. Make use of functions-skip implementing anything that's trivial (e.g., finding the\\nmaximum of an array) or standard (e.g., a thread pool). Best practices for coding on a whiteboard\\nare very different from best practices for coding on a production project. For example, don't worry\\nabout skipping documentation, or using the right indentation. Writing on a whiteboard is much\\nslower than on a keyboard, so keeping your identifiers short (our recommendation is no more than\\n7 characters) but recognizable is a best practice. Have a convention for identifiers, €.9.r i, j,k for\\narray indices, A, B, C for arrays, s for string, d for dict., etc.\\n1.4\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

(You should clarify this assumption with the interviewer.)\\nTest for corner cases: For many problems/ your general idea may work for most valid inputs\\nbut there may be pathological valid inputs where your algorithm (or your implementation of it)\\nfails. For example, your binary search code may crash if the input is an empty affay; or you may\\ndo arithmetic without considering the possibility of overflow.

              " Document(page_content='!rrr-rrrttl\\nWhat to ask\\nOne important question you should ask yourself as an interviewer is how much training time your\\nwork environment allows. For a startup it is important that a new hire is productive from the first\\nweek, whereas a larger organization can budget for several months of training. Consequently, in a\\nstartup it is important to test the candidate on the specific technologies that he will use, in addition\\nto his general abilities.\\nFor a larger organization, it is reasonable not to emphasize domain knowledge and instead test\\ncandidates on data structures, algorithms, system design skills, and problem solving techniques.\\nThe justification for this is as follows. Algorithms, data structures, and system design underlie all\\nsoftware. Algorithms and data structure code is usually a small component of a system dominated\\nby the user interface (UI), input/output (VO), and format conversion. It is often hidden in library\\ncalls. However, such code is usually the crucial component in terms of performance and correctness,\\nand often serves to differentiate products. Furthermore, platforms and programming languages\\nchange quickly but a firm grasp of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles, will\\nalways be a foundational part of any successful software endeavor. Finally, many of the most\\nsuccessful software companies have hired based on ability and potential rather than experience or\\nknowledge of specifics, underlying the effectiveness of this approach to selecting candidates.\\nMost big organizations have a structured interview process where designated interviewers are\\nresponsible for probing specific areas. For example, you may be asked to evaluate the candidate on\\ntheir coding skills, algorithm knowledge, critical thinking, or the ability to design complex systems.\\nThis book gives interviewers access to a fairly large collection of problems to choose from. lvVhen\\nselecting a problem keep the following in mind:\\nNo single point of failure-if you are going to ask just one question, you should not pick a\\nproblem where the candidate passes the interview if and only if he gets one particular insight. The\\nbest candidate may miss a simple insight, and a mediocre candidate may stumble across the right\\nidea. There should be at least two or three opportunities for the candidates to redeem themselves.\\nFor example, problems that can be solved by dynamic programming can almost always be solved\\nthrough a grcedy algorithm that is fast but suboptimum or a brute-force algorithm that is slow but\\noptimum. br such cases, even if the candidate cannot get the key insight, he can still demonstrate\\nsome problem solving abilities. Problem 5.6 on Page 46 exemplifies this type of question.\\nMultiple possible solutions-if a given problem has multiple solutions, the chances of a good\\ncandidate coming up with a solution increases. It also gives the interviewer more freedom to steer\\nthe candidate. A great candidate may finish with one solution quickly enough to discuss other\\napproaches and the trade-offs between them. For example, Problem 11.9 on Page 155 can be solved\\nusing a hash table or a bit array; the best solution makes use of binary search.\\nCover multiple areas---even if you are responsible for testing the candidate on algorithms, you\\ncould easily pick a problem that also exposes some aspects of design and software development.\\nFor example, Problem 19.8 on Page298 tests candidates on concurrency as well as data structures.\\nProblem 5.16 on Page 58 requires knowledge of both probability and binary search.\\nCalibrate on colleagues-interviewers often have an incorrect notion of how difficult a problem\\nis for a thirty minute or one hour interview.

Clearly, we cannot cache the parity of every 64-bit integer-we\\nwould need 2e bits of storage, which is of the order of two exabytes. However, when computing\\nthe parity of a collection of bits, it does not matter how we group those bits, i.e., the computation is\\nassociative. Therefore, we can compute the parity of a 64-bit integer by grouping its bits into four\\nnonoverlapping 16 bit subwords, computing the parity of each subwords, and then computing the\\nparity of these four subresults. We choose 16 since 216 = 65536 is relatively small, which makes it\\nfeasible to cache the parity of all 16-bit words using an array. Furthernore, since 16 evenly divides\\n64, the code is simpler than if we were, for example, to use 10 bit subwords.\\nWe illustrate the approach with a lookup table for 2-bit words. The cache is (0,1,1,0)-these\\nare the parities of (00), (01), (10), (11), respectively. To compute the parity of (11001010) we would\\ncompute the parities of (11), (00), (10), (10).

XOR has the property of being associative, i.e., it does not\\nmatter how we group bits, as well as commutative, i.e., the order in which we perform the XORs\\ndoes not change the result. The XOR of a group of bits is its parity. We can exploit this fact to use\\nthe CPU's word-level XOR instruction to process multiple bits at a tirne.\\nFor example, the parity of (b6,boz,. .. ,b3,bz, b1, bs) equals the parity of the XOR of\\n(boyboz,. . . ,by) and (b31, bn,. .., b6). The XOR of these two 32-bit values can be computed with a\\nsingle shift and a shgle 32-bit XOR instruction. We repeat the same operation on32-,16-,8-, 4-,\\n2-, and 1-bit operands to get the final result. Note that the leading bits are not meaningful, and we\\nhave to explicitly extract the result from the least-significant bit.\\nWe illustrate the approach with an 8-bit word.

The second XOR yields (11101100),\\nand only the last 2 bits are relevant. The third XOR yields (10011010).

Can you find a\\nsimple expression for the most significant digit?\\nSolution: First note that if the input is negative, then its representation as a decimal string cannot\\nbe palindromic, since itbegins with a -.\\nA brute-force approach would be to convert the input to a string and then iterate through the\\nstring, pairwise comparing digits starting from the least significant digit and the most significant\\ndigit, and working inwards, stopping if there is a mismatch. The time and space complexity are\\nO(n),where n is the number of digits in the input.\\nWe can avoid the O(n) space complexity used by the string representation by directly extracting\\nthe digits from the input. The number of digits, n, in the input\\'s string representation is the log\\n(base 10) of the input value, r. To be precise, n = llogro xJ + 1.. Therefore, the least significant digit\\nis r mod 10, and the most significant digit is xll}n-t.In the program below, we iteratively compare\\nthe most and least significant digits, and then remove them from the input. For example, if the\\ninput is \\'1.51751., we would compare the leading and trailing digits, 1 and 1. Since these are equal,\\nwe update the value to 5175. The leading and trailing digits are equal, so we update to 17. Now\\nthe leading and trailing are unequal, so we return false. If instead the number was157751, the final\\ncompare would be of 7 with7, so we would retum true.\\ndef is-palindrome-number (x)\\nifx<=0:\\nJJ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

Six friends have to select a designated driver\\nusing a single unbiased coin.

For example, two calls to the random number\\ngenerator will produce one of (00)2, (01)2, (10)2, (11)2. These four possible outcomes encode the four\\nintegers 0,7,2,3, and all of them are equally likely.\\nFor the general case, first note that it is equivalent to produce a random integer between 0 and\\nb - a, inclusive, since we can simply add a to the result. lf b - a is equal to 2i - 1, for some l, then we\\ncan use the approach in the previous paragraph.\\nlf b - a is not of the form 2i - 7, we find the smallest number of the form 2' - 1 that is greater\\nthan b - a. We generate an i-bit number as before. This l-bit number may or may not lie between 0\\nand b - a, inclusive. If it is within the range, we return it-all such numbers are equally likely. If it\\nis not within the range, we try again with I new random bits.

Observe that all six values between 1 and 6, inclusive, are equally likely to be retumed. If the\\nthree calls yields one of (110)2, (1.1.7)2, we make three more calls.

              " Document(page_content='A permutation can be specified by an array P, where P[] represents the location of the element\\nat i in the permutation. For example, the aray (2,0,1,3) represents the permutation that maps the\\nelement at location 0 to location 2, the element at location 1 to location 0, the element at location 2\\nto location 1, and keep the element at location 3 unchanged. A permutation can be applied to an\\narray to reorder the array. For example, the permutation (2,0, 1,3) applied to A = (a,b,c,d) yields\\nthe array \\\\b,c,a,d).\\nGiven an arrayA of n elements and a permutation P, apply P to A.\\nHint: Any permutation can be viewed as a set of cyclic permutations. For an element in a cycle, how would\\nyou identify if it has been permuted?\\nSolution: It is simple to apply a permutation-array to a given array if additional storage is available\\nto write the resulting array. We allocate a new array B of the same length, set B[P[i]l = A[i] for each\\nl, and then copy B to A. The time complexity is O(n), and the additional space complexity is O(n).\\nA key insight to improving space complexity is to decompose permutations into simpler struc-\\ntures which can be processed incrementally. For example, consider the permutation (3,2,1,0). To\\napply it to an array / = (a,b,c,6), we move the element at index 0 (a) to index 3 and the element\\nalready at index 3 (5) to index 0. Continuing, we move the element at index 1 (b) to index 2 and\\nthe element already at index 2 (c) to index 1. Now all elements have been moved according to the\\npermutation, and the result is (6,c,b,a).\\nThis example generalizes: every permutation can be represented by a collection of independent\\npermutations, each of which is cyclic, that is, it moves all elements by a fixed offret, wrapping\\naround.\\nThis is significant, because a single cyclic permutation can be performed one element at a time,\\ni.e., with constant additional storage. Consequently, if the permutation is described as a set of\\ncyclic permutations, it can easily be applied using a constant amount of additional storage by\\napplying each cyclic permutation one-at-a-time. Therefore, we want to identify the disjoint cycles\\nthat constitute the permutation.\\nTo find and apply the cycle that includes entry I we just keep going forward (from I to PU]) till\\nwe get back to l. After we are done with that cycle, we need to find another cycle that has not yet\\nbeen applied. It is trivial to do this by storing a Boolean for each array element.\\nOne way to perform this without explicitly using additional O(n) storage is to use the sign bit\\nin the entries in the permutation-array. Specifically, we subtract n from P[] after applying it. This\\nmeans that if an entry in P[r] is negative, we have performed the corresponding move.\\nFor example, to apply <3,7,2,0>, we begin with the first entry, 3. We move A[0] to A[3], first\\nsaving the original A[3]. We update the permutation to <-1.,1,2,0>. We move.4[3] to A[0]. Since\\nP[0] is negative we know we are done with the cycle starting at 0. We also update the permutation\\nto (-1,1.,2,-41. Now we examine P[1]. Since it is not negative, it means the cycle it belongs to\\ncannot have been applied.

We cannot get the next permutation just by modifying this suffix, since it is already\\nthe maximum it can be.\\nInstead we look at the entry e that appears just before the longest decreasing suffix, which is 1\\nin this case. (If there's no such element, i.e., the longest decreasing suffix is the entire permutation,\\nthe permutation must be (n - L,n - 2,.. . ,2,1,0), for which there is no next permutation.)\\nObserve that e must be less than some entries in the suffix (since the entry immediately after e is\\ngreater than e). Intuitively, we should swap e with the smallest entry s in the suffix which is larger\\nthan e so as to minimize the change to the prefix (which is defined to be the part of the sequence\\nthat appears before the suffix).\\nFor our example, e is 1 and s is 3. Swapping s and e results in <6,2,3,5,4,1,,0>.\\nWe are not done yet-the new prefix is the smallest possible for all permutations greater than\\nthe initial permutation, but the new suffix may not be the smallest. We can get the smallest suffix\\nby sorting the entries in the suffix from smallest to largest. For our working example, this yields\\nthe suffix <0,1.,4,5>.\\nAs an optimization, it is not necessary to call a full blown sorting algorithm on suffix.

A string may encode an integer, e.g., \"123\" encodes 123. In\\nthis problem, you are to irnplement methods that take a string representing an integer and retum\\nthe corresponding integer, and vice versa. Your code should handle negative integers. You cannot\\nuse library functions like int in Python.\\nImplement an integer to string conversion function, and a string to integer conversison function,\\nFor example, if the input to the first function is the integer 314,it should retum the string \"31.4\" and\\nif the input to the second function is the string \"314\" it should return the integer 314.\\nHint: Build the result one digit at a time.\\nSolution: Let\\'s consider the integer to string problem first. If the number to convert is a single\\ndigit, i.e., it is between 0 and 9, the result is easy to compute: it is the string consisting of the single\\ncharacter encoding that digit.\\nIf the number has more than one digit, it is natural to perform the conversion digit-by-digit. The\\nkey insight is that for any positive integer r, the least significant digit in the decimal representation\\nof r is r mod 10, and the remaining digits are x170. This approach computes the digits in reverse\\norder, e.g., if we begin wlth 423, we get 3 and are left with 42 to convert. Then we get 2, and are left\\nwith 4 to convert. Finally, we get 4 and there are no digits to convert. The natural algorithm would\\nbe to prepend digits to the partial result. However, adding a digit to the beginning of a string is\\nexpensive, since all remaining digit have to be moved. A more time efficient approach is to add\\neach computed digit to the end, and then reverse the computed sequence.\\nIf r is negative, we record that, negate x, and then add a \\'-\\'before reversing. If r is 0, our code\\nbreaks out of the iteration without writing any digits, in which case we need to explicitly set a 0.\\nTo convert from a string to an integer we recall the basic working of a positional number system.\\nA base-10 number dzddo encodes the number 102 x d2 + 101 x h + do.

The key\\nto efficiency is using an incremental hash function, such as a function with the property that the\\nhash code of a string is an additive function of each individual character.

For such a function, getting the hash code of a sliding\\nwindow of characters is very fast for each shift.\\nFor example, let the strings consist of letters frorn \\\\A,C,G,T).

The\\nhash code of the first three characters of t, \"GAC\", is 201, so s cannot be the first three characters\\nof f . Continuing, the next substring of f is \" ACG\" , whose hash code can be computed from 201 by\\nsubtracting 200, then multiplying by 1.O, and finally adding 2. This yields 12, so there no match\\nyet. We then reach \"CGC\" whose hash code, 121, is derived in a similar manner. We are not done\\nyet-there may be a collision.

This approach has O(n2) ttrne complexity.\\nThis idea can be made to work in linear time-use a slow iterator and a fast iterator to traverse\\nthe list. In each iteration, advance the slow iterator by one and the fast iterator by two. The list has\\na cycle if and only if the two iterators meet. The reasoning is as follows: if the fast iterator jumps\\nover the slow iterator, the slow iterator will equal the fast iterator in the next step.\\nNow, assuming that we have detected a cycle using the above method, we can find the start\\nof the cycle, by first calculating the cycle length C. Once we know there is a cycle, and we have a\\nnode on it, it is trivial to compute the cycle length. To find the first node on the cycle, we use two\\niterators, one of which is C ahead of the other. We advance them in tandem, and when they meet,\\nthat node must be the first node on the cycle.\\nThe code to do this traversal is quite simple:\\ndef has-cycIe (head) :\\ndef cycle-len(end):\\nstart , step = end, 0\\nrhile True:\\nstep += 1\\nstart = start.next\\nif start is end\\nreturn step7 5 3 2X M 11\\n86', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

This structure is sometimes referred to as a circular queue. Both enqueue and dequeue\\nhave O(1) time complexity. If the array is fixed, there is a maximum number of entries that can be\\nstored. If the array is dlmamically resized, the total time for rn combined enqueue and dequeue\\noperations is O(m).\\nImplement a queue API using an array for storing elements. Your API should include a constructor\\nfunctioru which takes as argument the initial capacity of the queue, enqueue and dequeue functions,\\nand a function which retums the number of elements stored. Implement dynamic resizing to\\nsupport storing an arbitrarily large number of elements.\\nHint:Trackthe head and tail. How can you diffurentiate a full queue from an empty one?\\nSolution: A brute-force approach is to use ar.arrayt with the head always at index 0. An additional\\nvariable tracks the index of the tail element. Enqueue has O(1) time complexity. However dequeue\\'s\\ntime complexity is O(n), where r is the number of elements in the queue, since every element has\\nto be left-shifted to fill up the space oeated at index 0.\\nA better approach is to keep one more variable to track the head. This way, dequeue can also\\nbe performed in O(1) time. lAIhen performing an enqueue into a full array, we need to resize the\\narray. We cannot only resize, because this results in queue elements not appearing contiguously.\\nFor example, if the array is (e,b,c,d), with e being the tail and b the head, if we resize to get\\n(e,b,c,d,-, -, -, -), we cannot enqueue without overwriting or moving elements.\\nclass Queue:\\nSCALE-FACTOR = 2\\ndef --init--(self , capacity) :\\nself.-entries - [None] * capacity\\nseIf.-head = se1f.-tail = self._num_queue_elements = 0\\ndef enqueue(self, x)\\n107', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

The max operation refurns the\\nmaximum element currently stored in the queue.\\nHint: When can an element never be returned by max, regardless of future updates?\\nSolution: A brute-force approach is to track the current maximum. The current maximum has to\\nbe updated on both enqueue and dequeue, Updating the current maximum on enqueue is trivial\\nand fast-just compare the enqueued value with the current maximum. However, updating the\\ncurrent maximum on dequeue is slow-we must examine every single remaining element, which\\ntakes O(n) time, where n is the size of the queue.\\nConsider an element s in the queue that has the property that it entered the queue before a later\\nelement, b, which is greater than s. Since s will be dequeued before b, s can never in the future\\nbecome the maximum element stored in the queue, regardless of the subsequent enqueues and\\ndequeues.\\nThe key to a faster implementation of a queue-with-max is to elirninate elements like s from\\nconsideration. We do this by maintaining the set of entries in the queue that have no later entry in\\nthe queue greater than them in a separate deque. Elements in the deque will be ordered by their\\nposition in the queue, with the candidate closest to the head of the queue appearing first. Since\\neach entry in the deque is greater than or equal to its successors, the largest element in the queue is\\nat the head of the deque.\\nWe now briefly describe how to update the deque on queue updates. If the queue is dequeued,\\nand if the element just dequeued is at the deque's head, we pop the deque from its head; otherwise\\nthe deque remains unchanged. When we add an entry to the queue, we iteratively evict from the\\ndeque's tail until the element at the tail is greater than or equal to the entry being enqueued, and\\nthen add the new entry to the deque's tail.

For example, the LCA of M and N in Figure 9.1 on Page 112 is K.\\nComputing the LCA has important applications. For example, it is an essential calculation\\nwhen rendering web pages/ specifically when computing the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) that is\\napplicable to a particular Document Object Model (DOM) element.\\nDesign an algorithm for computing the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree in which nodes do not\\nhave a parent field.\\nHinf: lAlhen is the root the LCA?\\nSolution: A brute-force approach is to see if the nodes are in different immediate subtrees of the\\nroot, or if one of the nodes is the root.

How would you programmatically find an IP address that is not in the file? Assume you\\nhave unlimited drive space but only a few megabytes of RAM at your disposal.\\nHint: Can you be sure there is an address which is not in the file?\\nSolution: Since the file can be treated as consisting of 32-bit integers, we can sort the input file\\nand then iterate through it, searching for a gap between values. The time complexity is O(nlogn),\\nwhere n is number of entries. Furthermore, to keep the RAM usage low, the sort will have to use\\ndisk as storage, which in practice is very slow\\nNote that we cannot just compute the largest entry and add one to it, since if the largest entry\\nis 255.255.255.255 (the highest possible IP address), adding one to it leads to overflow The same\\nholds for the smallest entry. (In practice this would be a good heuristic.)\\nWe could add all the IP addresses in the file to a hash table, and then enumerate IP addresses,\\nstarting with 0.0.0.0, until we find one not in the hash table. This requires a minimum of 4 gigabytes\\nof RAM to store the data.l\\nWe can reduce the storage requirement by an order of magnitude by using a bit array represen-\\ntation for the set of all possible IP addresses. Specifically, we allocate an array of 232 bits, initialized\\nto 0, and write a 1 at each index that corresponds to an IP address in the file. Then we iterate\\nthrough the bit array, looking for an entry set to 0.

Inserts,\\ndeletes and lookups run in O(1) time on average.\\nThe underlying idea is to store keys in an array. A key is stored in the array locations (\"slots\")\\nbased on its \"hash code\". The hash code is an integer computed from the key by a hash function.\\nIf the hash function is chosen well, the objects are distributed uniformly across the array locations.\\nIf two keys map to the same location, a \"collision\" is said to occur. The standard mechanism to\\ndeal with collisions is to maintain a linked list of objects at each array location. If the hash ftmction\\ndoes a good job of spreading objects across the underlying array and take O(1) time to compute, on\\naverage, lookups, insertions, and deletions have O(1 + n lm) time complexity, where n is the number\\nof objects arrd m is the length of the array. If the \"load\" n f m grows large, rehashing can be applied\\nto the hash table. A new array with a larger number of locations is allocated, and the objects are\\nmoved to the new array. Rehashing is expensive (O(n + ru) time) but if it is done infrequently (for\\nexample, whenever the number of entries doubles), its amortized cost is low.\\nA hash table is qualitatively different from a sorted array-keys do not have to appear in order,\\nand randomization (specifically, the hash function) plays a central role. Compared to binary search\\ntrees (discussed in Chapter 14), inserting and deleting in a hash table is more efficient (assuming\\nrehashing is infrequent). One disadvantage of hash tables is the need for a good hash ft:nction but\\nthis is rarely an issue in practice. Similarly, rehashing is not a problem outside of realtirne systems\\nand even for such systems, a separate thread can do the rehashing.\\nA hash function has one hard requirement-equal keys should have equal hash codes. This may\\nseem obvious, but is easy to get wrong, e.9., by writing a hash function that is based on address\\nrather than contents, or by including profiling data.\\nA softer requirement is that the hash ftrnction should \"spread\" keys, i.e., the hash codes for a\\nsubset of objects should be uniformly distributed across the underlying array. In addition, a hash\\nfimction should be efficient to compute.\\nA common mistake with hash tables is that a key that\\'s present in a hash table will be updated.\\nThe consequence is that a lookup for that key will now fail, even though it\\'s still in the hash table.\\nIf you have to update a key, first remove it, then update it, and finally, add it back-this ensures it\\'s\\nmoved to the correct array location.

This has a very high time complexity. Examining the approach in more detail, one\\nthing to note is that if a string begins with say \\'a\\', then we only need consider permutations that\\nend with \\'a\\'. This observation can be used to prune the permutation-based algorithm. Howevel,\\na more powerful conclusion is that all characters must occur in pairs for a string to be permutable\\ninto a palindrome, with one exception, if the string is of odd length. For example, for the string\\n\"edified\" , which is of odd length (7) there are two \\'e\\', two \\'d\\'s, two \\'i\\'s, and one \\'f\\'-this is enough\\nto guarantee that \"edified\" can be permuted into a palindrome.\\nMore formally, if the string is of even length, a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be a\\npalindrome is that each character in the string appears an even number of times. If the length is\\nodd, all but one character should appear an even number of times. Both these cases are covered by\\ntesting that at most one character appears an odd number of times, which can be checked using a\\nhash table mapping characters to frequencies.\\ndef can-form-palindrome (s) :\\n# A string can be permuted to forn a paTindrone if and onTy if the number\\n# of chars whose frequencies is odd is at most 1.\\nreturn sun(v X 2 for v in collections.Counter(s).valuesO) <= 1\\n1,63', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 176}),\n",

It is a\\nstring of length 10. The first 9 characters are digits; the last character is a check character. The check\\ncharacter is the sum of the first 9 digits, mod 11, with 10 represented by 'X'.(Modem ISBNs use\\n13 digits, and the check digit is taken mod 10; this problem is concerned with 10-digit ISBNs.)\\nCreate a cache for looking up prices of books identified by their ISBN. You implement lookup,\\ninsert, and remove methods. Use the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy for cache eviction. If an\\nISBN is already present, insert should not change the price, but it should update that entry tobe the\\nmost recently used entry. Lookup should also update that entry to be the most recently used entry.\\nHint: Amofilze the cost of deletion. Altematively, use an auxiliary data structure.\\nSolution: Hash tables are ideally suited for fast lookups. We can use a hash table to quickly lookup\\nprice by using ISBNs as keys. Along with each key, we store a value, which is the price and the\\nmost recent time a lookup was done on that key.\\nThis yields O(1) lookup times on cache hits. Inserts into the cache are also O(1) time, until the\\ncache is full. Once the cache fills up, to add a new entry we have to find the LRU entry, which will\\nbe evicted to make place for the new entry. Finding this entry takes O(n) time, where n is the cache\\nsize.\\nOne way to improve performance is to use lazy garbage collection. Specifically, let's say we\\nwant the cache to be of size n. We do not delete any entries from the hash table until it grows to\\n2n entries. At this point we iterate through the entire hash table, and find the median age of items.\\nSubsequently we discard everything below the median. The worst-case time to delete becomes\\nO(n)but it will happen at most once every n operations. Therefore, the amortized time to delete is\\nO(1). The drawback of this approach is the O(n) time needed for some lookups that miss on a full\\ncache, and the O(n) increase in memory,\\nAn altemative is to maintain a separate queue of keys. In the hash table we store for each key\\na reference to its location in the queue. Each time an ISBN is looked up and is found in the hash\\ntable, it is moved to the front of the queue. (This requires us to use a linked list implementation of\\nthe queue, so that items in the middle of the queue can be moved to the head.)

For each subarray, we test if all its elements are\\ndistinct using a hash table. The time complexity isO(n3),where n is the array length since there are\\nO(nz) subarrays, and their average length is O(n).\\nWe can improve on the brute-force algorithm by noting that if a subarray contains duplicates,\\nevery array containing that subarray will also contain duplicates. Therefore, for any given starting\\nindex, we can compute the longest subarray starting at that index containing no duplicates in time\\nO(rz), since we can incrementally add elements to the hash table of elements from the starting index.\\nThis leads to an O(n2) algorithm. As soon as we get a duplicate, we cannot find a longerbeginning\\nat the same initial index that is duplicate-free.\\nWe can improve the time complexity by reusing previous computation as we iterate through the\\narray. Suppose we know the longest duplicate-free subarray ending at a given index. The longest\\nduplicate-free subarray ending at the next index is either the previous subarray appended with the\\nelement at the next index, if that element does not appear in the longest duplicate-free subarray\\nat the current index. Otherwise it is the subarray beginning at the most recent occurrence of the\\nelement at the next index to the next index. To perform this case analysis as we iterate, all we need\\nis a hash table storing the most recent occurrence of each element, and the longest duplicate-free\\nsubarray ending at the current element.\\nFor the given example, (f,s,f,e,t,u),e,n,u),e), when we process the element at index 2, the\\nlongest duplicate-free subarray ending at index 1 is from 0 to 1. The hash table tells us that the\\nelement at index 2, namely f , appears in that subarray, so we update the longest subarray ending at\\nindex 2 to being from index '1, to 2.

For example, if the input is (3,-2,7,9,8,7,2,0, -1,5,8), the\\nlargest such subset is {-2, -1,,0,1,2,3}, so you should retum 6.\\nHint:Do you really need a total ordering on the input?\\nSolution: The brute-force algorithm is to sort the array and then iterate through it, recording for\\neach entry the largest subset with the desired property ending at that entry.\\nOn closer inspection we see that sorting is not essential to the functioning of the algorithm. We\\ndo not need the total ordering-allwe care are about is whether the integers adjacent to a givenvalue\\nare present. This suggests using a hash table to store the entries. Now we iterate over the entries in\\nthe array.

We do this by iteratively searching\\nentriesinthehashtableof theform e+L,et2,...,ande-1,e - 2,....

We initialize the hash table to\\n{6,10,3,11.,5,700,41.

The largest\\nset is {10,11} and is of size 2. This computation updates the hash table to 16,3,5,100,4}. The next\\nentry in A is 5. Since it is contained in the hash table, we know that the largest interval contained in\\nA including 5 has not been computed yet. Expanding from 5, we see that3,4,6 are all in the hash\\ntable, and 2 and7 are not in the hash table, so the largest set containing 5 is {3,4,5,6}, which is of\\nsize 4. We update the hash table to {100}. The three entries after 5, namely 3,11.,6 are not present in\\nthe hash table, so we know we have already computed the longest intervals inA containing each of\\nthese.

A number of sorting algorithms run in O(nlogn)\\ntime-heapsort, merge sort, and quicksort are examples. Each has its advantages and disadvan-\\ntages: for example, heapsort is in-place but not stable; merge sort is stable but not in-place; quicksort\\nruns O(n2) time in worst-case. (An in-place sort is one which uses 0(L) spacei a stable sort is one\\nwhere entries which are equal appear in their original order.)\\nA well-implemented quicksort is usually the best choice for sorting. We briefly outline altema-\\ntives that are better in specific circumstances,\\nFor short arrays, e.g., 10 or fewer elements, insertion sort is easier to code and faster than\\nasymptotically superior sorting algorithms. If every element is known to be at most k places from\\nits final location, a min-heap can be used to get an O(nlogk) algorithm (Solution 10.3 on Page 137).\\nIf there are a small number of distinct keys, e.g., integers in the range [0..255], counting sort, which\\nrecords for each element, the number of elements less than it, works well. This count can be kept in\\nan array (if the largest number is comparable in value to the size of the set being sorted) or a BSI\\nwhere the keys are the numbers and the values are their frequencies. If there are many duplicate\\nkeys we can add the keys to a BST, with linked lists for elements which have the same key; the\\nsorted result can be derived from an in-order traversal of the BST.\\nMost sorting algorithms are not stable. Merge sort, carefully implemented, can be made stable.\\nAnother solution is to add the index as an integer rank to the keys to break ties.\\nMost sorting routines are based on a compare function. However, it is also possible to use\\nnumerical attributes directly, e.9., in radix sort.\\nThe heap data structure is discussed in detail in Chapter 10, Briefly, a max-heap (min-heap)\\nstores keys drawn from an ordered set.

As before, its time complexity is O(Dn), where D is the difference between the two\\nextreme values and n is the number of intervals, which is rmacceptable when D is large.\\nWe can improve the run time by focusing on intervals instead of individual values. We perform\\nthe following iteratively: select an interval arbitrarily, and find all intervals it intersects with. If it\\ndoes not intersect any interval, nemove it from the set and add it to the result. Otherwise, take its\\nunion with all the intervals it intersects with (the union must itself be an interval), remove it and\\nall the intervals it intersects with from the result, and add the union to the set. Since we remove at\\nleast one interval from the set each time, and the time to process each interval (test intersection and\\nform unions) rs O(n), the time complexity is O(nz).\\nA faster implementation of the above approach is to process the intervals in sorted order, so that\\nwe can limit our attention to a subset of intervals as we proceed. Specifically, we begin by sorting\\nthe intervals on their left endpoints. The idea is that this allows us to not have to revisit intervals\\nwhich are entirely to the left of the interval currently being processed.\\nWe refer to an interval which does not include its left endpoint as being left-open. Left<losed,\\nright-open, and right-closed are defined similarly. lrVhen sorting, if two intervals have the same left\\nendpoint, we put intervals which are left-closed first. We break ties arbitrarily.\\nAs we iterate through the sorted array of intervals, we have the following cases:\\no The interval most recently added to the result does not intersect the current interval, nor does\\nits right endpoint equal the left endpoint of the current interval. In this case/ we simply add\\nthe current interval to the end of the result array as a new interval.\\no The interval most recently added to the result intersects the current interval. In this case, we\\nupdate the most recently added interval to the union of it with the current interval.\\no The interval most recently added to the result has its right endpoint equal to the left endpoint\\nof the current interval, and one (or both) of these endpoints are closed.

For example, if the array is (b,a,c,b,d,a,b,d) then (a,a,b,b,b,c,d,dl is an acceptable\\nreordering/ as is (d, d, c, a, a, b, b, b).\\nIf the entries are integers, this reordering can be achieved by sorting the array. If the number\\nof distinct integers is very small relative to the size of the array, an efficient approach to sorting\\nthe array is to count the number of occurrences of each distinct integer and write the appropriate\\nnumber of each integer, in sorted order, to the array.

If the array length is r,\\nthe time complexity is O(nlogn) and space complexity is O(1).

              " Document(page_content=\"Solution: A direct approach, based on the definition of a BST, is to begin with the root, and compute\\nthe maximum key stored in the root's left subtree, and the minimum key in the root's right subtree.\\nWe check that the key at the root is greater than or equal to the maximum from the left subtree and\\nless than or equal to the minimum from the right subtree. If both these checks pass, we recursively\\ncheck the root's left and right subtrees. If either check fails, we retum false.\\nComputing the minimum key in a binary tree is straightforward: we take the minimum of the\\nkey stored at its root, the minimum key of the left subtree, and the minimum key of the right subtree.\\nThe maximum key is computed similarly. Note that the minimum can be in either subtree, since a\\ngeneral binary tree may not satisfy the BST property.\\nThe problem with this approach is that it will repeatedly traverse subtrees. In the worst-case,\\nwhen the tree is a BST and each node's left child is empty, the complexrty is O(nz), where n is the\\nnumber of nodes. The complexity can be improved to O(n) by caching the largest and smallest keys\\nat each node; this requires O(n) additional storage for the cache.\\nWe now present two approaches which have O(n) time complexity.\\nThe first approach is to check constraints on the values for each subtree. The initial constraint\\ncomes from the root. Every node in its left (right) subtree must have a key less than or equal (greater\\nthan or equal) to the key at the root. This idea generalizes: if all nodes in a tree must have keys\\nin the range [/, uf , and the key at the root is zu (which itself must be between [, u], otherwise the\\nrequirement is violated at the root itself), then all keys in the left subtree must be in the range [, ar],\\nand all keys stored in the right subtree must be in the range [ru, a].\\nAs a concrete example, when applied to the BST in Figure 14.1 on Page198, the initial range is\\n[-*, *]. For the recursive call on the subtree rooted at B, the constraint is [-oo,19]; the 19 is the\\nupper bound required by A on its left subtree. For the recursive call starting at the subtree rooted at\\nF, the constraint is [7,19]. For the recursive call starting at the subtree rooted at K, the constraint is\\n123,431. The binary tree in Figure 9.1 on Page 112 is identified as notbeing a BST when the recursive\\ncall reaches C-the constraint is [-oo,6], but the key at F is 277, so the tree cannot satisfy the BST\\nproperty.\\ndef is-binary-tree-bst(tree, low-range=float('-inf'), high-range=float('inf'))\\nif not tree:\\nreturn True\\nelif not low-range <= tree.data <= high-range:\\nreturn False\\nreturn (is-binary-tree-bst (tree. left , low-range , tree. data)\\nand is-binary-tree-bst(tree.right, tree.data, high-range))\\nThe time complexity is O(n), and the additional space complexity is O(ft), where h is the height of\\nthe tree.\\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that an inorder traversal visits keys in sorted order. Further-\\nmore, if an inorder traversal of a binary tree visits keys in sorted order, then that binary tree must\\nbe a BST. (This follows directly from the definition of a BST and the definition of an inorder walk.)\\nThus we can check the BST property by performing an inorder traversal, recording the key stored\\nat the last visited node. Each time a new node is visited, its key is compared with the key of the\\npreviously visited node. If at any step in the walk, the key at the previously visited node is greater\\nthan the node currently being visited, we have a violation of the BST property.\\nAll these approaches explore the left subtree first. Therefore, even if the BST property does not\\nhold at a node which is close to the root (e.g., the key stored at the right child is less than the key\\n200\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 213}),\n",

Otherwise, we add its\\nchildren along with the corresponding constraint.\\nFor the example in Figure 14.1 on Page 198, we initialize the queue with (A, [-m, m]).

If this check retums true, we\\nretum true. Otherwise, we retum the result of the same check, swapping the roles of the first and\\nsecond nodes.

Adding fields to the nodes can speed up certain queries. As an example,\\nconsider the following problem.\\nSuppose you needed a data structure that supports efficient insertion, deletion, lookup of integer\\nkeys, as well as range queries, i.e., determining the number of keys that lie in an interval.\\nWe could use a BST, which has efficient insertion, deletion and lookup. To find the number of\\nkeys that lie in the interval lll,Vl,we could search for the first node with a key greater than or equal\\nto U, and then call the successor operation ( 9.10 on Page 123) until we reach a node whose key is\\ngreater than V (or we run out of nodes). This has O(h + m) time complexity, where h is the height of\\nthe tree and m is the number of nodes with keys within the interval. When m islarge, this become\\nslow\\nWe can do much better by augmenting the BST. Specifically, we add a size field to each node,\\nwhich is the number of nodes in the BST rooted at that node.\\nFor simplicity, suppose we want to find the number of entries that are less than a specified value.\\nAs an example, say we want to count the mrmber of keys less than 40 in the BST in Figure 14.1 on\\nPage 198, and that each node has a size field. Since the root A's key, 19, is less than 40, the BST\\nproperty tells us that all keys in A's left subtree are less than 40. Therefore we cEu:I add 7 (which\\nwe get from the left child's size field) and 1 (for A itself) to the running count, and recurse with A's\\nright child.\\nGeneralizing, let's say we want to count all entries less than o. We initialize count to 0. Since\\nthere can be duplicate keys in the tree, we search for the first occurrence of u in an inorder traversal\\nusing Solution1.4.2 on Page 201. (If a is not present, we stop when we have determined this.) Each\\ntime we take a left child, we leave count unchanged; each time we take a right child, we add one\\nplus the size of the corresponding left child. If u is present, when we reach the first occurrence of o,\\nwe add the size of o's left child, The same approach can be used to find the number of entries that\\nare greater than o, less than or equal to o, and greater than or equal to u.\\nFor example, to count the number of less than 40 in the BST in Figure 14.1 on Page 198 we would\\nsearch for 40. Since A's key, 19 is less than 40, we update count to 7 + L = 8 and continue from\\nL Since I's key, 43 is greater than 40, we move to I's left child, /. Since /'s key, 23 is less than 40,\\nupdate count to 8 + l. = 9, and continue from K. Since K's key,37 is less than 40, we update count\\nto 9 + 2 + L = 12, and continue from N. Since N's key, 41, is greater than 40, we move to N's left\\nchild, which is empty. No other keys can be less than 40, so we retum count, i.e.,12. Note how we\\navoided exploring A and K's left subtrees.\\nThe time bound for these computations is O(h), since the search always descends the tree. When\\nm islarge, e.g., comparable to the total number of nodes in the tree, this approach is much faster\\nthan repeated calling successor.\\nTo compute the number of nodes with keys in the intervallL,Ul, first compute the number of\\nnodes with keys less than L and the number of nodes with keys greater than U, and subtract that\\nfrom the total number of nodes (which is the size stored at the root).\\nThe size field can be updated on insert and delete without changing the O(h) time complexity\\nof both. Essentially, the only nodes whose size field change are those on the search path to the\\nadded/deleted node.

Each client is identified by a string.\\nEach client has a \"credit\", which is a nonnegative integer value. The server needs to maintain a\\ndata structure to which clients can be added, removed, queried, or updated. Lr addition, the server\\nneeds to be able to add a specified number of credits to all clients simultaneously.\\nDesign a data structure that implements the following methods:\\no Insert: add a client with specified credit, replacing any existing entry for the client.\\no Remove: delete the specified client.\\no Lookup: return the number of credits associated with the specified client.\\no Add-to-all: increment the credit count for all current clients by the specified amount.\\no Max: retum a client with the highest number of credits.\\nHint:Use additional global state.\\nSolution: A hash table is a natural data structure for this application. Howevel, it does not support\\nefficient max operations, nor is there an obvious way to perform the simultaneous increment, short\\ntraversing all entries. A BST does have efficient max operation, but it too does not natively support\\nthe global increment.\\nA general principle when addingbehaviors to an object is to wrap the object, and add functions\\nin the wraPPet which add behaviors before or after delegating to the object. In our contex! this\\nsuggests storing the clients in a BST, and having the wrapper track the total increment amount.\\nFor example, if we have clients A,B, C, with credits 1.,2,3, respectively, and want to add 5 credits\\nto each, the wrapper sets the total increment amount to 5. A lookup on B then is performed by\\nlooking up in the BST, which retums 2, and then adding 5 before returning. If we want to add 4\\nmore credits to each, we simply update the total increment amount to 9.\\nOne issue to watch out for is what happens to clients inserted after a call to the add-to-all\\nfunction. Continuing with the given example, if we were to now add D with a credit of 6, the\\nlookup would retum 6 + 9, which is an error.\\nThe solution is simple-subtract the increment from the credit, i.e., add D with a credit of\\n6 - 9 = -3 to the BST. Now a lookup for D will retum -3 + 9, which is the correct amount.\\nMore specifically, the BST keys are credits, and the corresponding values are the clients with\\nthat credit. This makes for fast max-queries. Howevet to perform lookups and removes by client\\nquickly, the BST by itself is not enough (since it is ordered by credit, not client id). We can solve this\\nby maintaini.g an additional hash table in which keys are clients, and values are credits. Lookup\\nis trivial. Removes entails a lookup in the hash to get the credit, and then a search into the BST to\\nget the set of clients with that credit, and finally a delete on that set.\\nclass Clientscreditslnfo :\\ndef __init__(self):\\nse1f._offset = 0\\nself._client_to_credit = {}\\nself ._credit_to_clients = bintrees.RBTreeo\\ndef insert (se1f, client_id , c) :\\nself . remove (client_id)\\nseIf.-client-to-creditIclient_id] = c - se1f._offset\\nself._credit_to_clients. setdefault(c - self ._offset,\\nsetO). add(client_id)\\n21.5', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 228}),\n",

E. WInrs, 1976\\nRecursion is an approach to problem solving where the solution depends partially on solutions to\\nsmaller instances of related problems. It is often appropriate when the input is expressed using\\nrecursive rules, such as a computer grammar. More generally, searching, enumeration, divide-\\nand-conquer, and decomposing a complex problem into a set of similar smaller instances are all\\nscenarios where recursion may be suitable.\\nA recursive function consists of base cases and calls to the same function with different argu-\\nments. TWo key ingredients to a successful use of recursion are identifying the base cases, which\\nare to be solved directly, and ensuring progress, that is the recursion converges to the solution.\\nA divide-and-conquer algorithm works by repeatedly decomposing a problem into two or more\\nsmaller independent subproblems of the same kind, until it gets to instances that are simple enough\\nto be solved directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the\\noriginal problem. Merge sort and quicksort are classical examples of divide-and-conquer.\\nDivide-and-conquer is not synonymous with recursion. In divide-and-conquet the problem is\\ndivided into two or more independent smaller problems that are of the same type as the original\\nproblem. Recursion is more general-there may be a single subproblem, e.g.,binary search, the\\nsubproblemsmaynotbe independent, e.9., dynamic programming, and they maynotbeof the same\\ntype as the original, e.9., regular expression matching. In addition, sometimes to improve runtime,\\nand occasionally to reduce space complexity, a divide-and-conquer algorithm is implemented using\\niteration instead of recursion.\\nRecursion boot camp\\nThe Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is a\\nclassic example of recursion.

A 2 x 2 Mboard can be covered with one triomino since it is of the same\\nexact shape.

Howeveq, you\\nwill quickly see that this line of reasoning does not lead you anywhere.\\nAnother hypothesis is that if a placement exists for an nxnlvfboard, then one also exists for a\\n2n x 2n Mboard. Now we can apply divide-and-conquer. Take four n x n lvlboards and arrange\\nthem to form a 2nx2n square in such a way that three of the Mboards have their missing square set\\ntowards the center and one Mboard has its missing square outward to coincide with the missing\\ncorner of a2n x 2n Mboard, as shown in Figure 15.1(b). The gap in the center can be covered with a\\ntriomino and, by hypothesis, we cal:r cover the four n x n Mboards with triominoes as well. Hence,\\na placement exists for any n that is a power of 2.

This can be done using\\nrecursion. Howeve{, there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of paths, which leads to huge\\ntime complexity.\\nThe problem statement asks for the number of paths, so we focus our attention on that. A\\nkey observation is that because paths must advance down or right, the number of ways to get to\\nthe bottom-right entry is the number of ways to get to the entry immediately above it, plus the\\nnumber of ways to get to the entry immediately to its left. Let\\'s treat the origin (0,0) as the top-left\\nentry. Generalizing, the number of ways to get to (i, j) is the number of ways to get to (i - 7, j)\\nplus the number of ways to get to (i, j- 1).

Furthermore, direct computation of ([) from this expression quickly results in the\\nnumerator or denominator overflowing if integer types are used, even if the final result fits in a\\n32-bit integer. If floats are used, the expression may not yield a 32-bit integer.\\nDesign an efficient algorithm for computing ([) which has the property that it never overflows if\\nthe final result fits in the integer word size.\\nHint: Write an equation.\\nSolution: Abrute-force approach would be to compute n(n-l)' ' '(n-k+l), then k(k- 1)' ' ' (3X2)(1),\\nand finally divide the former by the latter. As pointed out in the problem introduction, this can\\nlead to overflows, even when the final result fits in the integer word size.\\nIt is tempting to proceed by pairing terms in the numerator and denominator that have conunon\\nfactors and cancel them out. This approach is unsatisfactory because of the need to factor numbers,\\nwhich itself is challenging.\\nA better approach is to avoid multiplications and divisions entirely. Fundamentally, the binomial\\ncoefficient counts the number of subsets of size k in a set of size n. We could enumerate k-sized\\nsubsets of {0,1,,2,...,n- 1} sets using recursion, as in Solution 15.5 on Page226. The idea is as\\nfollows. Consider the rth element in the initial set. A subset of size k will either contain this element,\\nor not contain it. This is the basis for a recursive enumeration-find all subsets of size k - L amongst\\nthe first n - 1 elements and add the nth element into these sets, and then find all subsets of size k\\namongst the first n - 1 elements. The union of these two subsets is all subsets of size k.\\nHowever, since all we care about is th e number of such subsets, we can do much better complexity-\\nwise. The recursive enumeration also implies that the binomial coefficient must satisfy the following\\nformula:\\n(;)=(';').ft-l)\\nThis identity yields a straightforward recursion for ([).

L:r addition to getting keywords from a page/s con-\\ntent, you would like to get keywords from Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). For example,\\nbedbathandbeyond.com yields the keywords \"bed, bath, beyond,bat, hand\": the first two coming\\nfrom the decomposition \"bed bath beyond\" and the latter two coming from the decomposition \"bed\\nbat hand beyond\".\\nGiven a dictionary, i.e., a set of strings, and a narne, design an efficient algorithm that checks\\nwhether the name is the concatenation of a sequence of dictionary words.

For exarrrple, \"a\",\\n\" man\", \" a\", \" p)lan\", \" a\", \" canal\" is a valid sequence for \"amanaplanacanal\".\\nHint: Solve the generalized problem, i.e., determine for each prefix of the name whether it is the concatenation\\nof dictionary words.\\nSolution: The natural approach is to use recursion, i.e., find dictionary words that begin the\\nname, and solve the problem recursively on the remainder of the name.

If the coins are 5,25,10,1., if the first player is greedy and chooses 5, the second\\nplayer can pick up the 25. Now the first player will choose the 10, and the second player gets the\\n1, so the first player has a total of 15 and the second player has a total of 26. A better move for the\\nfirst player is picking up 1. Now the second player is forced to expose the25, so the first player will\\nachieve 26.\\nThe drawback of greedy selection is that it does not consider the opportunities created for the\\nsecond player. Intuitively, the first player wants to balance selecting high coins with minimizing\\nthe coins available to the second player.\\nThe second player is assumed to play the best move he possibly can. Therefore, the second player\\nwill choose the coin that maximizes his revenue. Call the sum of the coins selected by a player his\\nrevenue. Let R(a, b) be the maximum revenue a player can get when it is his tum to play, and the coins\\nremaining on the table are at indice s a to b, inclusive. Let C be an array representing the line of coins,\\ni.e., C[i] is the value of the lth coin. If the first player selects the coin at a, since the second player plays\\noptimally, the first playerwill end up with a total revenue of C[a]+S(a+7,b)-R(a+ 1, b), where S(a,b)\\nis the sum of the coins from positions a to b, inclusive. If he selects the coin at b, he will end up with\\na total revenue of C[b] + S(a,b - 7) - R(a, b - 1).

Since there are 2n subsequences of an array of length n, the time\\ncomplexity would be huge. Some heuristic pruning can be applied, but the program grows very\\ncumbersome.\\nIf we have processed the initial set of entries of the input array, intuitively this should help\\nus when processing the next entry. For the given example, if we know the lengths of the longest\\nnondecreasing subsequences that end at lndices O,l, . . .,5 and we want to know the longest nonde-\\ncreasing subsequence that ends at Index 6, we simply look for the longest subsequence ending at an\\nentry in.4[0,5] whose value is less than or equal to A[61. For Index 6 in the example in Figure 16.15,\\nthere are two such longest subsequences, namely the ones ending at Index 2 and Index 4, both of\\nwhich yield nondecreasing subsequences of length 3 ending at A[61.\\nGeneralizing, define t[i] to be the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence of A that\\nends at and includes Index i. As an example, for the array in Figure 16.1s, Ll6) = 3. The longest\\nnondecreasing subsequence that ends at Index I is of length 1 (if Alil is smaller than all preceding\\nentries) or has some element, say at Lrdex i, as its penultimate entry, in which case the subsequence\\nrestricted to A[0, j] must be the longest subsequence ending at Index i. Based on this, L[] is either\\n1 (if A[il is less than all previous entries), or 1 + max{Llj]li < i and A[7] < Ati)\\\\.\\nWe can use this relationship to compute L, recursively or iteratively. If we want the sequence as\\nwell, for each l, in addition to storing the length of the nondecreasing sequence ending at l, we store\\nthe index of the last element of the subsequence that we extended to get the value assigned to L[l].\\nApplying this algorithm to the example in Figure 16.15, we compute L as follows:\\n(1.)

As example, consider\\nmaking change for 48 pence in the old British currency where the coins came in30,24,12,6,3, arrd 1\\npence denominations. Suppose our goal is to make change using the smallest number of coins.\\nThe natural greedy algorithm iteratively chooses the largest denomination coin that is less than or\\nequal to the amount of change that remains to be made. If we try this for 48 pence, we get three\\ncoins-3O + 12 + 6. However, the optimum answer would be two cotns-14 + 24.\\nL:r its most general form, the coin changing problem is NP-hard, but for some coinages, the\\ngreedy algorithm is optimum----e.g., if the denominations are of the form {1, r,i,f\\\\. (An ad hoc\\nargument can be applied to show that the greedy algorithm is also optimum for US coinage.)\\nThe general problem can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time using DP in a manner similar to\\nProblem 16.6 on Page246.\\nSometimes, there are multiple greedy algorithms for a given problem, and only some of them\\nare optimum. For example, consider 2n cittes on a line, half of which are white, and the other half\\nare black. Suppose we need to pair white with black cities in a one-to-one fashion so that the total\\nlength of the road sections required to connect paired cities is minimized. Multiple pairs of cities\\nmay share a single section of road, e.g., if we have the pairing (0,4) and (1,2) then the section of\\nroad between Cities 0 and 4 can be used by Cities 1 and 2.\\nThe most straightforward greedy algorithm for this problem is to scan through the white cities,\\nand, for each white city, pair it with the closest unpaired black city. This algorithm leads to\\nsuboptimum results. Consider the case where white cities are at 0 and at 3 and black cities are at 2\\nand at 5. If the white city at 3 is processed first, it will be paired with the black city at 2, forcing the\\ncities at 0 and 5 to pair up, leading to a road length of 5. In contrast, the pairing of cities at 0 and 2,\\nand 3 and 5 leads to a road length of 4.\\nA slightly more sophisticated greedy algorithm does lead to optimum results: iterate through\\nall the cities in left-to-right order, pairing each city with the nearest unpaired city of opposite color.\\nNote that the pairing for the first city must be optimum, since if it were to be paired with any other\\ncity, we could always change its pairing to be with the nearest black city without adding any road.\\nThis observation can be used in an inductive proof of overall optimality.\\n259', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 272}),\n",

For example, we may want\\nto identify the users using excessive network bandwidth or IP addresses originating the most\\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. Here we consider a simplified version of this problem.\\nYou are reading a sequence of strings. You know a priori thatmore than half the strings are repetitions\\nof a single string (the \"majority element\") but the positions where the majority element occurs are\\nunknown. Write a program that makes a single pass over the sequence and identifies the majority\\nelement. For example, if the input is \\\\b,a,c,A,a,b,a,a,c,a>, then a is the majority element (it appears\\nin 6 out of the 10 places).\\nHint:Take advantage of the existence of a majority element to perform elimination.\\nSolution: The brute-force approach is to use a hash table to record the repetition count for each\\ndistinct element. The time complexity isO(n), where n is the number of elements in the input, but\\nthe space complexity is also O(n).\\nRandomized sampling can be used to identify a majority element with high probability using\\nless storage, but is not exact.\\nThe intuition for a better algorithm is as follows. We can Soup entries into two subgroups-\\nthose containing the majority element, and those that do not hold the majority element. Since the\\nfirst subgroup is given to be larger in size than the second, if we see two entries that are different,\\nat most one cim be the majority element. By discarding both, the difference in size of the first\\nsubgroup and second subgroup remains the same, so the majority of the remaining entries remains\\nunchanged.\\nThe algorithm then is as follows. We have a candidate for the majority element, and track its\\ncount. It is initialized to the first entry. We iterate through remaining entries. Each time we see an\\nentry equal to the candidate, we increment the count. If the entry is different, we decrement the\\ncount. If the count becomes zero, we set the next entry to be the candidate.\\nHere is a mathematical justification of the approach. Let\\'s say the majority element occurred m\\ntimes out of n entries. By the definition of majority element, 1 , i. At most one of the two distinct\\nentries that are discarded can be the majority element. Hence, after discarding them, the ratio of\\nthe number of remaining majority elements to the total number of remaining elements is either\\n1r-44 (neither discarded element was the majority element) \", ffi (one discarded element was the\\nmajorityelement).

The next element,\\na is different from the candidate, so the candidate\\'s count goes to 0. Therefore, we pick the next\\nelement c to be the candidate, and its count is 1. The next element, a, is dTfterent so the count goes\\nback to 0. The next element is a, which is the new candidate. The subsequent b decrements the\\ncount to 0.

(Many equivalent definitions exist, e.g., a graph is a free tree if and\\nonly if there exists a unique path between every pair of vertices.) There are a number of variants\\non the basic idea of a tree. A rooted tree is one where a designated vertex is called the root, which\\nleads to a parent-child relationship on the nodes. An ordered tree is a rooted tree in which each\\nvertex has an ordering on its children.

The random walk does suggest the right way-we should keep track of pixels\\nthat we have already visited.

Most other problems on graphs are either variants of these or, very likely, not solvable by\\npolynomial tirne algorithms. These four classes are:\\no Shortest path-given a graph, directed or undirected, with costs on the edges, find the minimum\\ncost path from a given vertex to all vertices. Variants include computing the shortest paths\\nfor all pairs of vertices, and the case where costs are all nonnegative.\\no Minimum spanning tree-$venan undirected graph G = (V,E), assumed to be connected, with\\nweights on each edge, find a subset E' of the edges with minimum total weight such that the\\nsubgraph 5,' = (V,E') is connected.\\no Matching-given an undirected graph, find a maximum collection of edges subject to the\\nconstraint that every vertex is incident to at most one edge. The matching problem for\\nbipartite graphs is especially corunon and the algorithm for this problem is much simpler\\nthan for the general case. A corunon variant is the maximum weighted matching problem in\\nwhich edges have weights and a maximum weight edge set is sought, subject to the matching\\nconstraint.\\no Maximumflow-gqvena directed graph with a capacity for each edge, find the maximum flow\\nfrom a given source to a given sink, where a flow is a function mapping edges to numbers\\nsatisfying conservation (flow into a vertex equals the flow out of it) and the edge capacities.\\nThe minimum cost circulation problem generalizes the maximum flow problem by adding\\nlower bounds on edge capacities, and for each edge, a cost Per unit flow.\\nThese four problem classes have polynomial time algorithms and can be solved efficiently in\\npractice for very large graphs. Algorithms for these problems tend to be specialized, and the natural\\napproach does not always work best. For example, it is natural to apply divide-and-conquer to\\ncompute the MST as follows. Partition the vertex set into two subsets, comPute MSTs for the\\nsubsets independently, and then join these two MSTs with an edge of minimum weight between\\nthem.

The first is a min-heap in which we insert key-value pairs: the keys\\nare run times and the values are the thread to run at that time. A dispatch thread runs these threads;\\nit sleeps from call to call and may be woken up if a thread is added to or deleted from the pool. If\\nwoken up, it advances or retards its remaining sleep time based on the top of the min-heap. On\\nwaking up, it looks for the thread at the top of the min-heap-if its larlnch time is the current time,\\nthe dispatch thread deletes it from the min-heap and executes it. It then sleeps till the launch time\\nfor the next thread in the min-heap. (Because of deletions, it may happen that the dispatch thread\\nwakes up and finds nothing to do.)\\nThe second data structure is a hash table with thread ids as keys and entries in the min-heaP as\\nvalues. If we need to cancel a thread, we go to the min-heap and delete it. Each time a thread is\\nadded, we add it to the min-heap; if the insertion is to the top of the min-heap, we interrupt the\\ndispatch thread so that it can adjust its wake up time.\\nSince the min-heap is shared by the update methods and the dispatch thread, we need to lock it.\\nThe simplest solution is to have a single lock that is used for all read and writes into the min-heap\\nand the hash table.\\n19.9 Trsr rHr Cor,r.erz coNTECTURE IN rARALLEL\\nIn Problem 12.11 on Page 776 and its solution we introduced the Collatz conjecture and heuristics\\nfor checking it.

Suffix removal does not always work. For example, wolves should be stemmed\\nto wolf. To cover this case, we may have a rule that replaces the suffix \"yes\" with\"f\".\\nMost rules amount to matching a set of suffixes and applying the corresponding transformation\\nto the string. One way of efficiently performing this is to build a finite state machine based on all\\nthe rules.\\nA more sophisticated system might have exceptions to the broad rules based on the stem\\nmatching some pattems.

We take a pair of files as having substantial commonality\\nif they have a substring of length k in common, where k is a measure of commonality. (Later, we\\nwill have a deeper discussion as to the validity of this model.)\\nLet li be the length of the string corresponding to the fth file.

A collision indicates that the two length-\\nk substrings are potentially the same.\\nSince we are computing hash code for each k length substring, it is important for efficiency to\\nhave a hash function which can be updated incrementally when we delete one character and add\\nanother.

You would like to\\npair each user with another unpaired user that specified the same set of attributes.\\nYou are given a sequence of users where each user has a unique 32-bit integer key and a set of\\nattributes specified as strings. Uy\\'hen you read a user, you should pair that user with another\\npreviously read user with identical attributes who is currently unpaired, if such a user exists. If the\\nuser cannot be paired, you should add him to the unpaired set.\\nHint: Map sets of atlributes to strings.\\nSolution: First, we examine the algorithmic core of this problem. Later we will consider imple-\\nmentation details, particularly those related to scale.\\nA brute-force algorithm is to compare each new user\\'s attributes with the attributes of users in\\nthe unpaired set. This leads to O(nz) time complexity, where n is the number of users.\\nTo improve the time complexity, we need a way to find users who have the same attributes as\\nthe new user. A hash table whose keys are subsets of attributes and values are users is the perfect\\nchoice. This leaves us with the problem of designing a hash function which is suitable for subsets\\nof attributes.\\nIf the total number of possible attributes is small, we can represent a subset of attributes with\\nabit anay, where each index represents a specific attribute. Specifically, we store a 1 at an index\\nif that attribute is present. We can then use any hash function for bit arrays. The time complexity\\nto process the n users is a hash lookup per uset i.e., O(nm), where tz is the number of distinct\\nattributes. The space complexity is also O(nm)-n entries, each of size m.\\nIf the set of possible attributes is large, and most users have a small subset of those attributes, the\\nbit vector representation for subsets is inefficient from both a time and space perspective. A better\\napproach to represent sparse subsets is directly record the elements. To ensure equal subsets have\\nequal hash codes, we need to represent the subsets in a unique way. One approach is to sort the\\nelements. We can view the sorted sequence of attributes as a single string, namely the concatenation\\nthe individual elements. We then use a hash function for strings. For example, if the possible\\nattributes are {USA, Senior, Income, Prime Customer}, and a user has attributes {USA, Income}, we\\nrepresent his set of attributes as the string \"Income,USA\".\\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(M), where M is the sum of the sizes of the attribute\\nsets for all users.\\nNow we consider implementation issues.

Unlike GUI\\nbased document editing programs, Tp[ relies on a markup language, which is compiled into a\\ndevice independent intermediate representation. Tp[ formats text, lists, tables, and embedded\\nfigures; supports avery rich set of fonts and mathematical symbols; automates section numbering,\\ncross-referencing, index generation; exports an API; and much more.\\nHow would you implement Tp[?\\nHint: There are two aspects--$uilding blocks (e.g., fonts, symbols) and hierarchical layout.\\nSolution: Note that the problem does not ask for the design of Tg[, which itself is a complex\\nproblem involving feature selection, and language design. There are a number of issues corunon\\nto implementing any such program: programming language selection, lexing and parsing input,\\nerror handling, macros, and scripting.\\nTwo key implementation issues specific to Tp[ are a specifying fonts and symbols (e.g., A,b, f,\\nL, f ,r),and assembling a document out of components.\\nFocusing on the second aspect, a reasonable abstraction is to use a rectangular bounding box to\\ndescribe components. The description is hierarchical: each individual symbol is a rectangle, lines\\nand paragraphs are made out of these rectangles and are themselves rectangles, as are section titles,\\ntables and table entries, and included images. A key algorithmic problem is to assemble these\\nrectangles, while preserving hard constraints on layout, and soft constraints on aesthetics. See also\\nProblem 16.11 on Page 254 for an example of the latter.\\nTuming our attention to symbol specification, the obvious approach is to use a 2D arcay of\\nbits to represent each symbol. This is referred to as a bit-mapped representation. The problem\\nwith bit-mapped fonts is that the resolution required to achieve acceptable quality is very high,\\nwhich leads to huge documents and font-libraries.

A reasonable approach is\\nto use a language that supports quadratic and cubic functions, and elementary graphics transforma-\\ntions (rotation, interpolation, and scaling). This approach overcomes the limitations of bit-mapped\\nfonts-parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, serif size, etc. can be programmed.\\nOther implementation issues include enabling cross-referencing, automatically creating indices,\\nsupporting colors, and outputting standard page description formats (e.g., pDF)).\\nDonald Knuth\\'s book\"DigitalTypography\" describes in great detail the design and implementa-\\ntion of Tp{.\\n20,7 DrsrcN A sEARcH ENGTNE\\nKeyword-based search engines maintain a collection of several billion documents.

In an inverted index, for\\neach word, we store a sequence of locations where the word occurs. The sequence itself could be\\nrepresented as an array or a linked list. Location is defined to be the document ID and the offuet in\\nthe document. The sequence is stored in sorted order of locations (first ordered by document ID,\\nthen by offtet). When we are looking for documents that contain a set of words, what we need to\\ndo is find the intersection of sequences for each word. Since the sequences are already sorted, the\\nintersection can be done in time proportional to the aggregate length of the sequences. We list a\\nfew optimizations below.\\no Compression--compressing the inverted index helps both with the ability to index more docu-\\nments as well as memory locality (fewer cache misses). Since we are storing sorted sequences,\\none way of compressing is to use delta compression where we only store the difference\\nbetween the successive entries. The deltas can be represented in fewer bits.\\no Caching-the distribution of queries is usually fairly skewed and it helps a great deal to cache\\nthe results of some of the most frequent queries.\\no Frequency-based optimization---+ince search results often do not need to retum every document\\nthat matches (only top ten or so), only a fraction of highest quality documents can be used to\\nanswer most of the queries. This means that we can make two inverted indices, one with the\\nhigh quality documents that stays in RAM and one with the remaining documents that stays\\non disk. This way if we can keep the number of queries that require the secondary index to a\\nsmall enough numbeq, then we can still maintain a reasonable throughput and latency.\\no lntersection order-stnce the total intersection time depends on the total size of sequences, it\\nwould make sense to intersect the words with smaller sets first. For example, if we are looking\\nfor \"USA GDP 2009\" , it would make sense to intersect the lists for GDP and 2009 before trying\\nto intersect the sequence for USA.\\nWe could also build a multilevel index to improve accuracy on documents. For a high priority web\\npage, we can decompose the page into paragraphs and sentences, which are indexed individually.\\nThat way the intersections for the words might be within the same context.

Some of the edges on each machine may correspond to\\nvertices that are owned by other machines. Hence the result vector contains nonzero entries\\nfor vertices that are not owned by the local machine.

Key features include:\\no LJser authentication-a way for users to create accounts and authenticate themselves. Alter-\\nnatively, use an existing single sign-on login service, e.g., Facebook or Google.\\no User input-a set of form elements to let advertisers specify ads, advertising budget, and\\nsearch keywords to bid on.\\no Performance reports-a way to generate reports on how the advertiser\\'s money is being spent.\\no Customer s€rvicmven the best of automated systems require occasional human interaction,\\ne.g\\'l ways to override limits on keywords. This requires an interface for advertisers to contact\\ncustomer service representatives, and an interface for those representatives to interact with\\nthe system.\\nThe whole front-end system can be built using, for example, HyperText Markup Language\\n(HTML) and |avaScript. A commonly used approach is to use a LAMP stack on the server-side:\\nLinux as the OS, Apache as the HTTP seryer, MySQf as the database software, and PHP for the\\napplication logic.\\nThe ad-serving system is less conventional. The ad-serving system would build a specialized\\ndata structure, such as a decision tree, from the ads database. It chooses ads from the database\\nof ads based on their \"relevance\" to the search. Lr addition to keywords, the ad-serving systems\\ncan use knowledge of the user\\'s search history, how much the advertiser is willing to pay, the time\\nof day, user locale, and type of browser. Ma.y strategies can be envisioned here for estimating\\nrelevance, such as, using information retrieval or machine leaming techniques that learn from past\\nuser interactions.\\nThe ads could be added to the search results by embedding lavaScript in the results page. This\\nJavaftript pulls in the ads from the ad-serving system directly. This helps isolate the latency of\\nserving search results from the latency of serving ad results.\\nThere are many more issues in such a system: making sure there are no inappropriate images\\nusing an image recognition API; using a link verification to check if keywords really corresponds to\\na real site; serving up images from a content-delivery network; and having a fallback advertisement\\nto show if an advertisement cannot be found.\\n315', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 328}),\n",

Several issues come up, such as the fact that frequently occurring words\\nsuch as \"for\" arrd \"the\" should be ignored and that having rare words such as \"arbltrage\" at:td\\n\"diesel\" in common is more significant than having say, \"sale\" and \"international\"\\'\\nTextual analysis has problems, such as the fact that two words may have the same spelling\\nbut completely different meanings (anti-virus means diffurent things in the context of articles on\\nacquired immune deficiency symdrome (AIDS) and computer security). One way to augment\\ntextual analysis is to use collaborative filtering-using information gleaned from many users.

In theory, this leads to an exponential reduction in the time taken to do the copy.\\nSeveral additional issues have to be dealt with.

How should the\\nknowledge of machines which do not yet have copies of the file be shared? (There can be a central\\nrepository or servers can simply check others by random selection.) If the bandwidth between\\nmachines in a data center is not a constant, how should the selections be made?

Specifically, describe what happens when you enter a URL in a\\nbrowser address bar, and press retum.\\nHint: Follow the flow of information.\\nSolution: At the network level, the browser extracts the domain n.une component of the URL, and\\ndetermines the IP address of the serve\\\\ e.g.t through a call to a Domain Name Server (DNS), or a\\ncache lookup. It then communicates using the HTTP protocol with the server. HTIP itself is built\\non top of TCPAR which is responsible for routing, reassembling, and resending packets, as well as\\ncontrolling the transmission rate.\\nThe server determines what the client is asking for by looking at the portion of the URL that\\ncomes after the domain name, and possibly also the body of the HTTP request. The request may\\nbe for something as simple a file, which is returned by the webserver; HTTP spells out a format by\\nwhich the type of the returned file is specified. For example, the URL http://go,com/imgs/abc.png may\\nencode a request for the file whose hierarchical name is imgs/abc.png relative to a base directory\\nspecified at configuration to the web server.\\nThe URL may also encode a request to a service provided by the web server. For example,\\nhttp://go.com/lookup/flight?num=UA37,city=AUS is a request to the lookup/flight service, with an argu-\\nment consisting of two attribute-value pair. The service could be implemented in many ways, e.g.t\\nJava code within the servel, or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script written in Perl.

WrrrcsNsrrrr.I\\n21,.1, Gennecr CorrscrroN\\nWhat is garbage collection? Explain it in the context of Python.\\nSolution: Garbage collection is the process of finding data objects in a running program that cannot\\nbe accessed in the future, and to reclaim the resources, particularly memory, used by those objects.\\nA garbage-collected language is one in which the garbage collection happens automatically-Java,\\nC#, Python, and most scripting languages are examples. C is a notable example of a nongarbage-\\ncollected language-the programmer is responsible for knowing when to allocate and deallocate\\nmemory.\\no Most garbage-collected languages used either reference counting (track the number of refer-\\nences to an object) or tracing (finding objects that are reachable by a sequence of references\\nfrom certain \"root\" objects, and considering the rest as \" garbage\" and collecting them). Python\\nuses reference counting, which has the benefit that it can immediately reclaim objects when\\nthe reference count goes to 0; the cost for this is the need for storing an additional integer-value\\nper object. Tracing, which is used in Java, has the benefit that it can be performed in a separate\\nthread, which makes it higher performance. A weakness of tracing is that when the garbage\\ncollector runs, it pauses all threads-this leads to nondeterministic performance (sporadic\\npauses).\\no A challenge with reference counting is \"reference cycles\"-objects A and B reference each\\nother, e.g., A .u = B andB.a = A. The reference count never drops below 1-, even if nothing else\\nreferences A and B. The garbage collector periodically looks for these, and removes them.\\no Garbage collectors used heuristics for speed. For example, empirically, recently created objects\\nare more likely to be dead. Therefore, as objects are created, they are assigned to generations,\\nand younger generations are examined first.\\n21.2 Crosunn\\n\\\\A/hat does the following program print, and why?\\nincrement-by_i = [Iaubda x: x + i for i in range(lO)]\\nprint (incrernent-by-i t3l (4) )\\n319', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 332}),\n",

When is each appropriate, and\\nwhen is neither appropriate? How is deep copy implemented?\\nSolution: First, we note that assignment in Python does not copy-it simply a variable to a target.\\nFor objects that are mutable, or contain mutable items, a copy is needed if we want to change the\\ncopywithoutchangingtheoriginal. Forexample,tf A = U, 2, 4, 8l andweassignAtoB,i'e.,B\\n= A, then if we changeB, e.g., B. append(16), then A will also change.\\nThere are two ways to make a copy: shallow and deep. These are implemented in the copy\\nmodule, specifically as copy.copy(x) and copy.deepcopy(x). A shallow copy constructs a new\\ncompound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in\\nthe original. A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies\\ninto it of the objects found in the original.\\nAsaconcreteexample,suPPoseA = [lL, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]l andB = copy.copy(A).Thenif\\nweupdateBasB[0][0] = 0,AtOltOl alsochangesto0. However,if B = coPy.deepcopy(A),then\\nthe same update will leave A unchanged.\\nThe difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects, that\\nis objects that contain other objects, such as lists or class instances. If A = lL, 2, 3l and B =\\ncopy. copy(A), then if we update B as B [0] = 0, A is unchanged.\\nDiving under the hood, deep copy is more challenging to implement since recursive objects\\n(compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) result in infinite\\nrecursion in a naive implementation of deep copy. Furthermore, since a deep copy copies every-\\nthing, it may copy too much, e.g., book-keeping data struchrres that should be shared even between\\ncopies. The copy. deepcopyO function avoids these problems by caching objects already copied,\\nand letting user-defined classes override the copying operation. In particular, a class can override\\none orboth of--copy--O and --deepcopy--O.\\nCopying is defensive-it may avoided if it's known that the client will not mutate the object.\\nSimilarly, if the object is itself immutable, e.g., a tuple, then there's no need to copy it.\\n320\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 333}),\n",

Quicksort is a good example of a template method-\\nsubclasses can implement their own pivot selection algorithm, e.g., using randomized median\\nfinding or selecting an element at random, and their own partitioning method, e.g., using the DNF\\npartitioning algorithms in Solution 5.1 on Page 40.\\nSince there may be multiple ways in which to sort elements, e.g., student objects may be\\ncompared by GPA, majo1, name, and combinations thereof, it\\'s natural to make the comparison\\noperation used by the sorting algorithm an €rgument to quicksort.

Sometimes a hook is not\\nimplemented, thereby forcing the subclasses to implement that functionality; some times it offers a\\n\"no-operation\" or some baseline functionality. There is no analog to a hook in a strategy pattern.\\nNote that there\\'s no relationship between the template method pattem and template meta-\\nprogramming (a form of generic programming favored in C++).\\n22.2 Onsrnvrn PATTERN\\nExplain the observer pattem with an example.\\nSolution: The observer pattem defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when\\none object changes state all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\\nThe observed object must implement the following methods.\\nr Register an observer.\\no Remove an observer.\\no Notify all currently registered observers.\\nThe observer object must implement the following method.\\no Update the observer. (Update is sometimes refeffed to as notify.)\\nAs a concrete example, consider a service that logs user requests, and keeps track of the 10\\nmost visited pages. There may be multiple client applications that use this information, e.g., a\\nleaderboard display, ad placement algorithms, recorunendation system, etc. Instead of having\\nthe clients poll the service, the service, which is the observed object, provides clients with register\\nand remove capabilities. As soon as its state changes, the service enumerates through registered\\nobservers, calling each observer\\'s update method.\\nThough most readily understood in the context of a single program, where the observed and\\nobserver are objects, the observer pattern is also applicable to distributed computing.\\n22.3 Pusu vs. PULL oBsERvER PATTERN\\nIn the observer pattem, subjects push information to their observers. There is another way to\\nupdate data-the observers rr.ay \"ptrll\" the information they need from the subject.

With the push design, the subject notifies the observer that its data is ready and\\nincludes the relevant information that the observer is subscribing to, whereas with the pull design,\\nit is the observer\\'s job to retrieve that information from the subject.\\nThe pull design places a heavier load on the observers, but it also allows the observer to query\\nthe subject only as often as is needed. One important consideration is that by the time the observer\\nretrieves the information from the subject, the data could have changed.

Use concrete\\nexamples.\\nSolution: The singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point\\nof access to it. The flyweight pattern minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible\\nwith other similar objects. It is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated\\nrepresentation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.\\nA common example of a singleton is a logger. There may be many clients who want to listen to\\nthe logged data (console, hle, messaging service, etc.), so all code should log to a single place.\\nA common example of a flyweight is string inteming-a method of storing only one copy of\\neach distinct string value. Inteming strings makes some string processing tasks more time- or\\nspace-efficient at the cost of requiring more time when the string is created or intemed. The distinct\\nvalues are usually stored in a hash table. Since multiple clients may refer to the same flyweight\\nobject for safety flyweights should be immutable.\\nThere is a superficial similarity between singleton and flyweight both keep a single copy of an\\nobject. There are several key differences between the two:\\no Flyweights are used to save memory. Singletons are used to ensure all clients see the same\\nobject.\\no A singleton is used where there is a single shared object, e.g., a database corurection, server\\nconfigurations, a logger, etc. A flyweight is used where there is a family of shared objects,\\ne.g., objects describing character fonts, or nodes shared across multiple binary search trees.\\no Flyweight objects are invariable immutable. Singleton objects are usually not immutablll e.g,\\nrequests can be added to the database connection object.\\no The singleton pattem is a creational pattern, whereas the flyweight is a structural pattem.\\nIn summary a singleton is like a global variable, whereas a flyweight is like a pointer to a canonical\\nrepresentation.\\nSometimes, but not always, a singleton object is used to meate flyweights---dients ask the\\nsingleton for an object with specified fields, and the singleton checks its intemal pool of flyweights\\nto see if one exists. If such an object already exists, it returns that, otherwise it creates a new\\nflyweight, add it to its pool, and then retums it. (L:r essence the singleton serves as a gateway to a\\nstatic factory.)\\n335\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 348}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='22.5 Apeprrns\\n\\\\,Vhat is the difference between a class adapter and an object adapter?\\nSolution: The adapter pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used from another\\ninterface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source\\ncode.\\nThere are two ways to build an adapter: via subclassing (the class adapter pattern) and com-\\nposition (the object adapter pattern). In the class adapter pattem, the adapter inherits both the\\ninterface that is expected and the interface that is pre-existing. In the object adapter pattern, the\\nadapter contains an instance of the class it wraps and the adapter makes calls to the instance of the\\nwrapped object.\\nHere are some remarks on the class adapter pattem.\\no The class adapter pattern allows re-use of implementation code in both the target and adaptee.\\nThis is an advantage in that the adapter doesn\\'t have to contain boilerplate pass-throughs or\\ncut-and-paste reimplementation of code in either the target or the adaptee.\\no The class adapter pattem has the disadvantages of inheritance (changes in base class may\\ncause unforeseen misbehaviors in derived classes, etc.). The disadvantages of inheritance are\\nmade worse by the use of two base classes, which also precludes its use in languages like Java\\n(prior to |ava 1.8) that do not support multiple inheritance.\\no The class adapter can be used in place of either the target or the adaptee. This can be advantage\\nif there is a need for a two-way adapter. The ability to substitute the adapter for adaptee can\\nbe a disadvantage otherwise as it dilutes the purpose of the adapter and may lead to incorrect\\nbehavior if the adapter is used in an unexpected manner.\\no The class adapter allows details of the behavior of the adaptee to be changed by overriding\\nthe adaptee\\'s methods. Class adapters, as members of the class hierarchy, are tied to specific\\nadaptee and target concrete classes.\\nAs a concrete example of an object adapter, suppose we have legacy code that returns objects of\\ntype stack. Newer code expects inputs of type deque, which is more general than stack (but does not\\nsubclass stack). We could create a new type, stack-adapter, which implements the deque methods,\\nand can be used anywhere deque is required. The stack-adapter class has a field of type stack-this\\nis referred to as object composition. It implements the deque methods with code that uses methods\\non the composed stack object. Deque methods that are not supported by the underlying stack throw\\nunsupported operation exceptions.

It avoids\\nmutability and inconsistent state by using an mutable inner class that has a build method that\\nretums the desired object, Its key benefits are that it breaks down the construction process/ and can\\ngive names to steps. Compared to a constructor, it deals far better with optional parameters and\\nwhen the parameter list is very long.\\nA static factory is a function for construction of objects. Its key benefits are as follow: the\\nfunction\\'s niune c€u:r make what it\\'s doing much clearer compared to a call to a constructor. The\\nfunction is not obliged to create a new object-in particulaq, it can retum a flyweight. It can also\\nreturn a subtype that\\'s more optimized, e.g., it can choose to construct an object that uses an integer\\nin place of a Boolean array if the array size is not more than the integer word size.\\nA factory method defines interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class\\nto instantiate. The classic example is a maze game with two modes-one with regular rooms, and\\none with magic rooms.

A bigger issue is that a line-based merge may succeed, but the resulting program is\\nbroken because of syntactic or semantic conflicts. In the scenario in Figure 23.1 on the next page\\nthe changes made by the two developers are made to independent lines, so the line-based merge\\nshows no conflicts. However, the program will not compile because a function is called incorrectly.\\nIn spite of this, line-based merging is widely used because of its efficiency, scalability,and\\naccuracy. A three-way, line-based merge tool in practice will merge 90\"/\" of the changed files\\nwithout any issues. The challenge is to automate the remainingl0% of the situations that cannot\\nbe merged automatically.\\nText-based merging fails because it does not consider any syntactic or semantic information.\\nSyntactic merging takes the syntax of the programming language into account. Text-based merge\\noften yields unimportant conflicts such as a code comment that has been changed by different\\ndevelopers or conflicts caused by code reformatting. A syntactic merge can ignore all these: it\\ndisplays a merge conflict when the merged result is not syntactically correct\\'\\nWe illustrate syntactic merging with a small example:\\nif (n%2 == 0) then m = n/2;\\nTWo developers change this code in a diffurent ways, but with the same overall effect. The first\\nupdatesit to\\nif (n%2 == 0) then n = n/2 else m = (n-L) /2;\\nand the second developer\\'s update is\\nm = n/2;\\nBoth changes to the same thing.

If a hook script refurns a nonzero exit code, the\\nversion control system aborts the action, refurning the script's standard error output to the user.\\nThe following hook scripts are used most often:\\no pre-commif: Executed before a change is committed to the repository.

To be precise, it specifies a group of related\\nmethods with empty bodies. (All methods ate nonstatic and public.) Interfaces have many benefits\\noveq, for example, abstract classes-in particulaq, they are a good way to implement polymorphic\\nfunctions in ]ava.\\nDescribe the advantages and disadvantages of Python and java for polymorphism. In particulal,\\nhow would you implement a polymorphic function in Python?\\nSolution: )ava\\'s polymorphism is first-class. The compiler is aware at compile-tirne of whatever\\ninterfaces (in the general sense) an object exposes-regardless of whether they derive from actual\\ninterfaces or from superclasses. As a result, a polymorphic function in Java has a guarantee that\\nany argument to it implements the methods it will call during its execution.\\nIn Python, however, no such safety exists. So there are two tricks to use when implementing\\na polymorphic function in Python. First, you can specify your classes using multiple inheritance.\\nIn this case, mEuly of the superclasses are simply interface specifications. These classes, mix-ins,\\nmay implement the desired methods or leave them for the subclass to implement. In effect, they\\nprovide a poor-man\\'s interface. (However, they\\'re not as robust as Java\\'s solution since the method\\nresolution order gets tricky in multiple-inheritance scenarios.)\\nBut there is a trickier problem here, which is that even if a class is implemented with a particular\\nmethod, it\\'s trivial at runtime to overvrrrite that method, e.g., with None, before passing it as an\\nargument. So you still don\\'t have any guarantees. This motivates the second trick, which is the\\nuse of \"duck typing\"-that is, rather than trying to get some safety guarantee that cannot exist in\\nPython, just inspect the object at runtime to see if it exposes the right interface. (The phrase comes\\nfrom this adage: \"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and acts like a duck, then it\\'s probably\\na duck\".) So, where in |ava a developer might write a function that only accepts arguments that\\nimplement a Drawable interface, in Python you would simply call that object\\'s draw method and\\nhope for the best. Type checking still exists here; it\\'s just deferred to runtime, which implies it may\\nthrow exceptions. The function is still quite polymorphic-more so, in some sense, since it can\\naccept literally any object that has a draw method.\\nBuild systeffis\\nA program typically cannot be executed immediately after change: intermediate steps are required\\nto build the program and test it before deploying it.

Each table consists of\\nrows. A row is a set of columns (also known as fields or attributes), which could be of various types\\n(integer, float, date, fixed-size string, variable-size string, etc.). SQL is the language used to create\\nand manipulate such databases. MySQL is a popular relational database.\\nA NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled\\nby means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. MongoDB is a popular\\nNoSQL database. The analog of a table in MongoDB is a collection, which consists of documents.\\nCollections do not enforce a schema. Documents can be viewed as hash maps from fields to values.\\nDocuments within a collection can have different fields.\\nA key benefit of NoSQL databases is simplicity of design: a field can trivially be added to new\\ndocuments in a collection without this affecting documents already in the database. This makes\\nNoSQL a popular choice for startups which have an agile development environment.\\nThe data structures used by NoSQL databases, e.g., key-value pairs in MongoDB, are different\\nfrom those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL.\\nNoSQL databases are typically much simpler to scale horizontally, i.e., to spread documents from\\na collection across a cluster of machines.\\nA key benefit of relational databases include support for ACID transactions.

For example, there is no way in MongoDB to remove an item from inventory\\nand add it to a customer\\'s order as an atomic operation.\\nAnother benefit of relational database is that their query language, SQL, is declarative, and\\nrelatively simple.

A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields)\\nin one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

Another table called Employee Details has\\na foreign key which references employee-id in order to uniquely identify the relationship between\\nboth the tables. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an\\nattribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using\\nthe defined foreign keys.\\nThe primary drawback of normalization is performance-often, a large number of joins are\\nrequired to recover the records the application needs to function.\\n345', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 358}),\n",

A router has multiple\\ninput and output ports. It forwards packets through the network using routing tables that tell the\\nrouter which output port to forward in incoming packet to. Specifically, a routing table maps IP\\nprefixes to output ports. For example, an entry in the routing table may indicate that all packets\\nwith destination IP address matching 171.23. *. * are to be forwarded out the interface port with\\nid 17. IP routers exchange \"link state information\" to compute the routing tables; this computation\\nis a kind of shortest path algorithm.\\nTCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, is an end-to-end protocol built on top of IP. It creates a\\na continuous reliable bidirectional connection. It does this by maintaining state at the two hosts-\\nthis state includes IP packets that have been received, as well as sending acknowledgements. It\\nresponds to dropped packets by requesting retransmits----each TCP packet has a sequence number.\\nThe receiver signals the transmitter to reduce its transmission rate if the drop rate becomes high-it\\ndoes this by reducing the received window size. TCP also \"demultiplexes\" incoming data using\\nthe concept of port number-this allows multiple applications on a host with a single IP address to\\nwork simultaneously.\\nHTTR the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is built on top of TCP. An HTTP request or response\\ncan be viewed as a text string consisting of a header and a body. The HTTP request and responses\\nheader specify the type of the data through the Content-Type field. The response header includes\\na code, which could indicate success (\"2@\"), a variety of failures (\"4}4\"-resource not found), or\\nmore specialized scenarios (\"302\"-use cached version). A few other protocol fields are cookies,\\nrequest size, compression used.\\nHTTP was designed to enable the world-wide web, and focused on delivering web pages in a\\nsingle logical transaction. Its generality means that it has grown to provide much more, e.g., it\\'s\\ncommonly used to access remote procedures (\"services\"). An object-which could be a web page,\\na file, or a service-is addressed using a URL, Uniform Resource Locator, which is a domain n€une,\\na path, and optional arguments.

Because of the commercial impor-\\ntance of the Intemet, and the prevalence of wireless networks, it\\'s imperative to protect data from\\neavesdroppers-this is not done automatically by IP/ICP/HTTP.\\nConceptually, one way to encrypt a channel is for the communicating parties to XOR each\\ntransmitted byte with a secret byte-the receiver then XORs the received bytes with the secret.\\nThis scheme is staggeringly weak-an eavesdropper can look at statisfics of the transmitted data to\\neasily figure out which of the 255 bytes is the secret. It leaves open the question of how to get the\\nsecrete byte to the receiver. Furthermore, a client who initiates a transaction has no way of knowing\\nif someone has hijacked the network and directed traffic from the client to a malicious server.\\nSSL resolves these issues. First of all, it uses public key cryptography for key exchange-the idea\\nis that the public key is used by the client to encrypt and send a secret key (which can be viewed\\n347', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/GenerativeAI/LLM_tut/Data/Mixed Data/[Elements of Programming Interviews] Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash - Elements of Programming Interviews in Python_ The Insiders’ Guide (2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) - libgen.lc.pdf', 'page': 360}),\n",

This secret key is\\nused to scramble the data to be transmitted in a recoverable way. The secret key is generated via\\nhashing a random number. Public key cryptography is based on the fact that it\\'s possible to create\\na one-way function, i.e., a function that can be made public and is easy to compute in one direction,\\nbut hard to invert with the public information about it. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman introduced\\na prototypical such function which is based on several number theoretic facts, such as the relative\\nease with which primes can be created, that computing ab mod c is fast, and that factorization is\\n(likely) hard.\\nPrivate key cryptography involves a single key which is a shared secret between the sender\\nand recipient. Private key cryptography offers many orders of magnitude higher bandwidth than\\npublic key cryptography. For this reason, once the secret key has been exchanged via public key\\ncryptography, HTTPS turns to private key cryptography, specifically AES. AES operates on 128 bit\\nblocks of data. (If the data to be transmitted is less than 128 bits, it\\'s padded up; if it\\'s greater than\\n128bits, it\\'s broken down into 128bit chunks.) The l28bitblock is represented as 16bytes na4x4\\nmatrix. The secret key is used to select an ordering in which to permute the bytes; it is also used to\\nXOR the bits. This operation is reversible using the secret key.\\nA small shortcoming of the scheme described above is that it is susceptible to replay attacks-an\\nadversary may not know the exact contents of a transmission, but may know that it represents an\\naction (\"add 10 gold coins to my World-Of-Warcraft account\"). This can be handled by having the\\nseryer send a random number which must accompany client requests.\\nHTTPS adds another layer of security-SSl certificates. The third party issuing the SSL certificate\\nverifies that the HTTPS server is on the domain that it claims to be on, which precludes someone\\nwho has hijacked the network from pretending to be the server being requested by the client. This\\ncheck is orthogonal to the essence of SSL (private key exchange and AES), and it can be disabled,\\ne.g., for testing a server locally.\\n23.12 DNS\\nDescribe DNS, including both operational as well as implementation aspects.\\nSolution: DNS is the system which translates domain narnes-www. google. com-to numerical IP\\naddresses-216. 58 . 218 . 110. It is essential to the functioning of the Intemet. DNS is what makes it\\npossible for a browser to access a website-the routers in the Internet network rely on IP addresses\\nto lookup next-hops for packets.\\nThere are many challenges to implementing DNS. Here are some of the most important ones.\\no There are hundreds of millions of domains.\\no There are hundreds of billions of DNS lookups a day.\\no Domains and IP addresses are added and updated continuously.\\nTo solve these problems, DNS is implemented as a distributed directory service. A DNS lookup\\nis addressed to a DNS server. Each DNS server stores a database of domain names to IP addresses;\\nif it cannot find a domain name being queried in this database it forwards the request to other\\nDNS servers. These requests can get forwarded all the way up to the root name servers, which are\\nresponsible for top-level domains.\\nAt the time of writing there are L3 root name servers. This does not mean there are exactly 13\\nphysical servers. Each operator uses redundancy to provide reliable service. Additionally, these\\nservers are replicated across multiple locations.

This problem\\nis restricted to strings of parens. Specifically, this problem is concerned with a long substrings of\\nmatched parens.

Therefore, a faster approach is for each I to find the longest\\nsubstring starting at the lth character that is matched. This leads to anO(nz) algorithm.\\nFinally, if a substring ends in an unmatched right parens, but all of that substring\\'s prefixes\\nending in right parens are matched, then no nonempty suffix of the prefix can be the prefix of a\\nmatched string, since any such suffix has fewer left parens. Therefore, as soon as a prefix has an\\nr.rnmatched right parens, we can continue with the next character after that prefix. We store the left\\nparentheses\\' indices in a stack. At the same time, when we process a right Parens for the given\\nprefix, if it matched, we use the index at the top of the stack to update the longest matched string\\nseen for this prefix.\\nFor the given example, \"((0)0((X\", *e push left parentheses and pop on right parentheses.\\nBefore the first pop, the stack is <0,\\'J,,2>, where the first array element is the bottom of the stack.

One of the challenges with this approach is to determine where to\\nretum to.\\nNow we address the problem of implementing a postorder traversal without recursion. First\\nwe discuss a roundabout way of doing this. An inverted preorder traversal is the following: visit\\nroot, inverted preorder traverse the right subtree, then inverted preorder traverse the left subtree.\\nFor example, the inverted preorder traversal of the tree in Figure 9.1 on PageTl}visits nodes in the\\nfollowing order: <A, l, O, P, I, K N, L, M, B, F, G, H, C, E, D).\\nIntuitively, since the inverted preorder traversal is visit root, traverse right, traverse left, its\\nreverse is traverse left, traverse right, visit root, i.e., the postorder traversal. Therefore, one way to\\ncomPute the postorder traversal visit sequence without using recursion is to perform an inverted\\npreorder traversal and instead of outputting nodes, we store them. When the inverted preorder\\ntraversal is complete, we iterate through the nodes in last-in, first-out ordel, which gives the\\npostorder traversal sequence.\\nThe inverted preorder traversal itself can be performed nonrecursively using the solution to the\\nfirst part of this problem, with the order in which the left and right children are pushed swapped.\\nThis algorithm is implemented in the code below.\\ndef postorder-traversal (tree) :\\ndef inverted-preorder_traversal (tree) :\\npath-stack, result = [tree] , []\\nrhile path_stack:\\ncurr = path_stack.popo\\nif not curr:\\ncontinue\\nresult . append (curr. data)\\npath_stack. extend([curr. 1eft, curr.right])\\nreturn result\\nreturn inverted_preorder_traversal (tree) [: : -1]\\nThe time and space complexity are both O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\\nIn addition to its being unintuitive, a more technical limitation of the approach given above is\\nthat it requires O(n) additional space. If the result is to be retumed as an array, this is unavoidable.\\nHowever, if we are simply required to print the nodes, it is possible to reduce the space complexity\\nto O(h) where fu is the height of the tree.\\nWe know that a recursive implementation of a postorder traversal takes O(n) and O(h) space, so\\nwe should be able to achieve this complexity by using a stack to mirnic the function call stack. One\\nchallenge is keeping track of where to retum to, since there are two recursive calls. The function\\ncall stack keeps a retum address, but instruction addresses are not accessible from user code.

Next we perform\\nthe following iteration. We check if all developers are satisfied. If they are all satisfied, we are\\ndone. Otherwise, if some developer is not satisfied, i.e., he has written more lines of code than a\\nneighbor, but does not have more tickets than that neighbol, we give him one more ticket than his\\nneighbor. This approach uses the minimum number of tickets initially, and every additional ticket\\nthat is given is necessary. The time complexity is O(kn2), where k is the maximum number of tickets\\ngiven to any single developer, and n is the number of developers.\\nThe key insight to a better algorithm is the observation that the least productive developer\\nnever needs to be given more than a single ticket. We can propagate this observation by processing\\ndevelopers in increasing order of productivity. Subsequently, when we process a developer if his\\nneighbors have been processed, he must be at least as productive as them. If a developer is more\\nproductive than a neighbor, he must be given at a minimum one more ticket than that neighbor.\\nIf a developer is only as productive as his neighbors, we only need give him the same number of\\ntickets, as per the problem specification.\\nFor the given example, our algorithm starts by trving 1 ticket to David. Andy is next in order\\nof productivity, so we give him 1 ticket, since he has only one neighbor, who is more productive\\nthan him. Next we process Bob. He is more productive than Andy, so we give him 1 + 1 = 2 tickets.\\nThen comes Charlie. He is a neighbor of Charlie and David, and is more productive than both, so\\nwe give him max(2,1) + 1 = 3 tickets, for a total of 7 tickets.\\nThis approach yields the correct result because once a developer is processed, we only process\\ndevelopers who are at least as productive in the future, meaning that once his bonus is assigned, it\\nwill never need updating in the future.

Specifically, the XOR of elements at indices\\nl},i - 1,1, determines exactly which bit-positions have been odd number of times in elements of the\\ninput array whose indices are in [0, ] - 1].\\nThe analogous approach for the current problem is to count mod 3 for each bit-position the\\nnumber of times the bit in that position has been 1. The effect of counting mod 3 is to eliminate\\nthe elements that appear three times, and so the bit-positions which have a count of L are precisely\\nthose bit-positions in the count which are set to 1.\\nThe example affay, <2,4,2,5,2,5,5), expressed in binary is ((010)2, (100)2, (010)2, (101)2, (010)2,\\n(101)2, (101)2).

If the case does not break, we know it is able to last to a fifth\\nfloor drop.\\nIf we have two cases and are allowed 5 drops, we can do better. For example, we could test by\\ndropping from floors 2, 4, 6, 8, 9. lf a case breaks on the first four drops, we have narrowed the\\ncritical floor to that floor or the one below it. We can test the one below it with the second case. If\\nthe case breaks on the fifth drop, we know the critical floor is 9.

Compression consists of concatenating the bit strings for each char-\\nacter to form a bit string for the entire text. (The codebook, i.e., the mapping from characters to\\ncorresponding bit strings is stored separately, e.g., in a preamble.)\\nWhen decompressing the string, we read bits until we find a string that is in the code book and\\nthen repeat this process until the entire text is decoded. For the compression to be reversible, it\\nis sufficient that the code words have the property that no code word is a prefix of another. For\\nexample, 011 is a prefix of 0110 but not a prefix of 1100.\\nSince our objective is to compress the text, we would like to assign the shorter bit strings to\\nmore common characters and the longer bit strings to less common characters. We will restrict our\\nattention to individual characters. (We may achieve better compression if we examine corunon\\nsequences of characters, but this increases the time complexity.)\\nThe intuitive notion of commonness is formaluedby the frequency of a character which is a\\nnumber between zero and one. The sum of the frequencies of all the characters is 1. The average\\ncode length is defined to be the sum of the product of the length of each character's code word with\\nthat character's frequency.

To be precise, if\\nthere are n distinct characters, we can use fiog nl bits per character. If all characters are equally\\nlikely, this is optimum, but when there is large variation in frequencies, we can do much better.\\nA natural heuristic is to split the set of characters into two subsets, which have approximately\\nequal aggregate frequencies, solve the problem for each subset, and then add a 0 to the codes from\\nthe first set and a 1 to the codes from the second set to differentiate the codes from the two subsets.\\nThis approach does not always result in the optimum coding, e.g., when the characters are A,B,C,D\\nwith frequencies {0.4,0.35,0.2,0.05}, it forms the code words 00, 10, 1'1,,01, whereas the optimum\\ncoding is 0, 10, 110, 111. It also requires being able to partition the characters into two subsets whose\\naggregate frequencies are close, which is computationally challenging.\\nAnother strategy is to assign 0 to the character with highest frequency, solve the same problem\\non the remaining characters, and then prefix those codes with a 1. This approach fares very poorly\\nwhen characters have the same frequency, e.g., if A,B,C,D all have frequency 0.25, the resulting\\ncoding is 0, 10, 100, 111, whereas 00,01, 10, 11 is the optimum coding. Intuitively, this strategy fails\\nbecause it does not take into account the relative frequencies.\\nHuffrnan coding yields an optimum solution to this problem. (There may be other optimum\\ncodes as well.) It is based on the idea that you should focus on the least frequent characters, rather\\nthan the most frequent ones. Specifically, combine the two least frequent characters into a new\\ncharacter, recursively solve the problem on the resulting n - 1 characters; then create codes for the\\ntwo combined characters from the code for their combined character by adding a 0 for one and a 1\\nfor the other.\\nMore precisely, Huffman coding proceeds in three steps:\\n(1.) Sort characters in increasing order of frequencies and create a binary tree node for each\\ncharacter. Denote the set just created by S.\\n(2,) Create a new node u whose children are the two nodes with smallest frequencies and assign\\na's frequency to be the sum of the frequencies of its children.\\n(3.)

Can you recast the problem so that it can be\\ncalculated additively?\\nSolution: Drawing pictures is a great way to brainstorm for a potential solution. Lr this case, the\\nrelationships between the currencies can be represented using a graph. Specifically, we can model\\nthe problem with a graph where currencies correspond to vertices, exchanges correspond to edges,\\nand the edge weight is set to the logarithm of the exchange rate, If we can find a cycle in the graph\\nwith a positive weight, we would have found such a series of exchanges. Such a cycle can be solved\\nusing the Bellman-Ford algorithm.\\nWe define a weighted directed graph 5, : (V,E = V x V), where V corresponds to the set of\\ncurrencies. The weight w(e) of edge e = (u,a) is the amount of currency o we can buy with one unit\\nof currency a. Observe that an arbitrage exists if and only if there exists a cycle in G whose edge\\nweights multiply out to more than 1.\\nCreate a new graph 6,' = (V,E) with weight function w'(e) = -logw(e). Since log(a xb) =\\nloga + log b, there exists a cycle in G whose edge weights multiply out to more than 1 if and only if\\nthere exists a cycle in G' whose edge weights sum up to less than log 1 = 0. (This property is true\\nfor logarithms to any base, so if it is more efficient for example to use base-e, we can do so.)\\nThe Bellman-Ford algorithm detects negative-weight cycles. Usually, finding anegative-weight\\ncycle is done by adding a dummy vertex s with 0-weight edges to each vertex in the given graph and\\nrunning the Bellman-Ford single-source shortest path algorithm from s. However, for the arbitrage\\nproblem, the graph is complete.
